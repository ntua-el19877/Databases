There are plenty of funny elevator stories, observations, and a super sexy marathon that will make you blush. My babies, JYD and Prissy, are scattered throughout chapter 1. Stand-Up Comedy While Sitting can be found mid-way though chapter 1. Pictured is a younger virgin* of myself. Do things ever make U say Huh? We have a few in the first three hundred pages. The Supreme Court has made three controversial decisions. 1962-1973 and 2015. A lot has been written about these three decisions. What is next for America?",

        "summary": "\"3-D Human Modeling and Animation fills a tremendous void that has become even more evident with the successful use of 3-D in movies like Disney's Toy Story. While there has been much written about drawing the human form in relation to art, commercial design, and 2-D cartooning, the subject of 3-D modeling and animation of the human form has been neglected at the same time that the use of 3-D tools has been exploding. It is my judgment that [this] book will become the reference that professional and student artists and animators turn to in order to master one of the most challenging yet exciting subjects to model and animate-the human form.\" -Nick Pavlovic, CEO, Visual Information Development, Inc., Monrovia, CA Ideal for graphic designers, artists, and others, 3-D Human Modeling and Animation builds a bridge from traditional figure drawing, painting, and sculpture to the creation and animation of figures using computer technology. With a step-by-step approach, the book leads readers through the process of modeling human figures, with specific yet flexible techniques that can be applied to many different hardware/software setups. Separate chapters cover different areas of the body, and contain everything readers need to know about proportion, basic design strategies, 3-D construction methods, and other essential information. The final chapters show how to prepare figures for animation and get them up and running-and jumping, walking, turning, and twisting! Complete with illustrations, helpful exercises, and more, 3-D Human Modeling and Animation opens up a whole new world of creative possibilities to explore.",

        "summary": "To date, the theoretical development of q-calculus has rested on a non-uniform basis. Generally, the bulky Gasper-Rahman notation was used, but the published works on q-calculus looked different depending on where and by whom they were written. This confusion of tongues not only complicated the theoretical development but also contributed to q-calculus remaining a neglected mathematical field. This book overcomes these problems by introducing a new and interesting notation for q-calculus based on logarithms.For instance, q-hypergeometric functions are now visually clear and easy to trace back to their hypergeometric parents. With this new notation it is also easy to see the connection between q-hypergeometric functions and the q-gamma function, something that until now has been overlooked. The book covers many topics on q-calculus, including special functions, combinatorics, and q-difference equations. Apart from a thorough review of the historical development of q-calculus, this book also presents the domains of modern physics for which q-calculus is applicable, such as particle physics and supersymmetry, to name just a few.\u200b",

        "summary": "The only how-to guide offering a unified, systemic approach to acquiring, cleaning, and managing data in R Every experienced practitioner knows that preparing data for modeling is a painstaking, time-consuming process. Adding to the difficulty is that most modelers learn the steps involved in cleaning and managing data piecemeal, often on the fly, or they develop their own ad hoc methods. This book helps simplify their task by providing a unified, systematic approach to acquiring, modeling, manipulating, cleaning, and maintaining data in R. Starting with the very basics, data scientists Samuel E. Buttrey and Lyn R. Whitaker walk readers through the entire process. From what data looks like and what it should look like, they progress through all the steps involved in getting data ready for modeling. They describe best practices for acquiring data from numerous sources; explore key issues in data handling, including text/regular expressions, big data, parallel processing, merging, matching, and checking for duplicates; and outline highly efficient and reliable techniques for documenting data and recordkeeping, including audit trails, getting data back out of R, and more. The only single-source guide to R data and its preparation, it describes best practices for acquiring, manipulating, cleaning, and maintaining data Begins with the basics and walks readers through all the steps necessary to get data ready for the modeling process Provides expert guidance on how to document the processes described so that they are reproducible Written by seasoned professionals, it provides both introductory and advanced techniques Features case studies with supporting data and R code, hosted on a companion website A Data Scientist's Guide to Acquiring, Cleaning and Managing Data in R is a valuable working resource/bench manual for practitioners who collect and analyze data, lab scientists and research associates of all levels of experience, and graduate-level data mining students.",

This is the only introduction needed to start programming in R, the computing standard for analyzing data. Co-written by an R core team member and an established R author, this book comes with real R code that complies with the standards of the language. Unlike other introductory books on the R system, this book emphasizes programming, including the principles that apply to most computing languages, and techniques used to develop more complex projects. Solutions, datasets, and any errata are available from the book's website. The many examples, all from real applications, make it particularly useful for anyone working in practical data analysis.",

        "summary": "From ads for Victoria's Secret to the character roles of Rosie Perez, the mass media have been defining race and femininity. In this diverse set of essays, Angharad N. Valdivia breaks theoretical and methodological boundaries by exploring the relationship of the media to various audiences. Throughout A Latina in the Land of Hollywood we are challenged to think differently about the media messages we often unconsciously consume, such as the popular representations of certain Latina cultural icons. Valdivia shows how reporters focus on Guatemalan activist Rigoberta Mench\u00fa's big smile, Brazilian media magnate Xuxa's blonde hair, and Puerto Rican actress Rosie Perez's high-pitched voice, never quite creating a comprehensive portrayal of these women. In her discussion of lingerie catalogs, Valdivia uncovers a similarly skewed depiction. The lush, high-class bedrooms of Victoria's Secret differ as much from the earthy, spare world of Frederick's of Hollywood as the types, sizes, and uses of the lingerie that the two companies sell. Valdivia takes a look at family films, arguing that single mothers are almost always portrayed as either trampy floozies or sexless, hapless women, whereas single dads fare much better. Whether examining one teenager's likes and dislikes or considering single parenthood in family films, Valdivia investigates how popular culture has become the arena in which we struggle to know ourselves and to make ourselves known. She calls for scholars to move beyond investigating implicit themes in films and media to studying the ways that audiences of different colors, ages, genders, and sexual preferences might understand or misunderstand such cultural messages. A Latina in the Land of Hollywood aims to explode traditional discussions of media and popular culture. It is a must-read for anyone interested in popular culture, television, and film.",

        "summary": "After thirty years of study and reflection, Lutheran philosopher Robert Koons joined the Catholic Church in 2007. This book articulates his reasons for abandoning the church of his ancestors for the Roman communion, reasons that centered on a deep and systematic re-thinking of the central issue of the Reformation: the Lutheran doctrine of justification by faith alone. Koons draws on a broad knowledge of the Scriptures, the Church Fathers, and the most prominent theologians of the Lutheran movement from the time of the Reformation until the present, including Luther, Melanchthon, Chemnitz, and Robert Preus. Since Jesus clearly intended for the church to remain visibly united, the burden of proof on any theological innovation is heavy, and Koons demonstrates that the Lutheran doctrine was innovative, and he argues, relying on the best New Testament scholarship, that the Bible passages cited by the Reformers do not support the innovative features of the Lutheran doctrine. Koons seeks to eliminate widespread misunderstandings of the Catholic doctrine of justification on the part of many Protestants, emphasizing the christocentric character of that teaching. Koons argues that, in contrast, the Lutheran doctrine is inconsistent. He also points out serious logical problems with the principle of sola scriptura.",

He is famous as the author of 'Auld Lang Syne', and he has long been the patron saint of the heartsore and the hungover. But what about the poems? Beneath the cult of Burns Nights and patriotic yawps, there is the work itself, among the purest and most truthful created in any age. This is a Burns collection like no other, introduced, arranged and contextualised by the award-winning novelist and essayist Andrew O'Hagan. Above all, it is an accessible edition made for the pleasure of reading that brings Burns' timeless work to full, riotous, colourful life.",

The ethics of communication, therefore, has to address a wide range of technical, ethical and epistemic requirements. In this book, Onora O'Neill shows how digital technologies have made communication more demanding: they can support communication with huge numbers of distant and dispersed recipients; they can amplify or suppress selected content; and they can target or ignore selected audiences. Often this is done anonymously, making it harder for readers and listeners, viewers and browsers, to assess which claims are true or false, reliable or misleading, flaky or fake. So how can we empower users to assess and evaluate digital communication, so that they can tell which standards it meets and which it flouts? That is the challenge which this book explores.",

This new selection of his best short stories spans a literary career of almost eight decades, and was published to celebrate his centenary in 2003. Beginning in 1928 with the fantastical world of Mortmere in The Railway Accident, the stories continue through the era of political engagement in the Thirties to the reflective and poignant studies of old age that have underpinned his revival in the past decade. Together they represent a lifetime of achievement in modern literature.",

        "summary": "The present study used the California Q-set (CQ-set) and Q-sort methodology (Block, 1961) to study how African American clinical psychologists conceptualize optimal mental health. Specifically, the study examined how their Q-sort descriptions vary as a function of the race of the target and the Afrocentricity of the judges. Template Q-sorts were developed to represent the collective judgment of a group of individual judges' Q- sorts. When the conventional Q-sort template matching method was used to analyze the data, the template Q-sorts of optimal mental health were virtually the same regardless of the target of the sort (European American or African American) or the psychologists' level of Afrocentricity (high or low). Furthermore, African American psychologists' conceptualizations of optimal mental health were also essentially the same as European American clinical psychologists' (Block, 1961) description of optimal mental health. A unique aspect of this study is that the data were also analyzed using an ANOVA model. By assessing the levels of variance within various groups of individual Q-sorts and the variance between groups, it was determined that it is possible for templates to be highly correlated and significantly different. Finally, although the templates were highly similar, participants reported that they believed optimal mental health was different for an African American and a European American. Thus, the appropriateness of using the CQ-set to conceptualize optimal mental health from a non-Eurocentric perspective is explored.",

        "summary": "In a high-tempo series of operations throughout the Black Sea, Aegean Sea and eastern Mediterranean, a small American fleet of destroyers and other naval vessels responded ably to several major international crises including the last days of the Russian Revolution and the 1920-1922 Turkish Nationalist Revolution. Officers and men of the navy's \"four-piper\" destroyers began by investigating circumstances on the ground in mainland Turkey right after World War I, and by transporting American relief teams to ports throughout Turkey and Southern Russia to aid the tens of thousands of orphans and refugees who had survived the wartime Armenian genocide. Then the destroyers assisted in the final evacuation of 150,000 White Russians from the Crimea to Constantinople (one of the final acts of the Russian Revolution); coordinated the visits of the Hoover grain ships to ports in Southern Russia where millions were enduring a horrendous famine; witnessed and reported on the terrible dolorosa of the Greeks of the Pontus regious of Turkey; and, in September of 1922, conducted the evacuation of hundreds of thousands of Greek and Armenian refugees from burning Smyrna. This latter event was the cataclysmic conclusion of the Turkish Nationalist Revolutino, which had begun in early 1920. After Smyrna, the destroyers escorted Greek steamers in their rescue of ethnic Christian civilians being expelled from all the ports of Anatolian Turkey. As the conclusion of a long war between Nationalist Turks and an invading Hellenic Greek army, these people were being forced out of their ancestral homes by the Turks. Sometimes American destroyers carried hundreds of such refugees to friendly ports on their own weather decks. Upon the burning of Smyrna of September of 1922, Admiral Mark Bristol's small fleet had grown to some 26 naval vessels, most of them destroyers, although some cruisers, naval repair vessels and supply ships also came, and the battleships Arizona and Utah also appeared briefly. It was during 1922 that the destroyer BAinbridge rescued 482 of 495 men, women and children from the burning French transport Vinh Long in teh Sea of Marmora. The destroyer accomplished this by the expedient of ramming the large French ship so the exploding ammunition could not continue to force the vessels apart. For this action, Lieut.Commander W. Atlee Edwards was awarded the Medal of Honor by America, and the Legion of Honor by France. Over four years, Admiral Bristol maintained a strong grip on American naval and diplomatic affairs throughout the region. Headquartered at the American Embassy at Constantinople, Bristol also worked to further American business interests in Turkey, and tended to favor Turks over Greeks and Armenians in the process. Many Americans were convinced that Bristol was biased on behalf of the Turks, and a couple of navy captains risked their careers by speaking out about impending Turkish massacres that Bristol wanted to hush up.",

This system acts as an external interface between the complementary nondestructive testing methods and computer based structural analysis. In the book the testing and analysis techniques are presented and compared with special emphasis on problems regarding their combination and integration. The architecture and the components of the interface system are described. Experiments proving the feasibility and applicability of the concepts are presented. The chapters of the book dealing with the different techniques are written by the individual partners of the project. A common test object is investigated by all techniques. The book helps the customer to select the testing and analysis method most suitable for his problem. It also presents the background for building up integrated testing equipment for analysis and control.",

The book helps you find the most appropriate statistical method to tackle your sensory data issue. Covering quantitative, qualitative, and affective approaches, the book presents the big picture of sensory evaluation. Through an integrated approach that connects the different dimensions of sensory evaluation, you\u2019ll understand: The reasons why sensory data are collected The ways in which the data are collected and analyzed The intrinsic meaning of the data The interpretation of the data analysis results Each chapter corresponds to one main sensory topic. The chapters start with presenting the nature of the sensory evaluation and its objectives, the sensory particularities related to the sensory evaluation, details about the data set obtained, and the statistical analyses required. Using real examples, the authors then illustrate step by step how the analyses are performed in R. The chapters conclude with variants and extensions of the methods that are related to the sensory task itself, the statistical methodology, or both.",

        "summary": "Angina pectoris with normal coronary arteriograms is a common entity which has puzzled cardiologists almost since the advent of coronary arteriography. Despite major advances in the understanding of the pathophysiology of angina in recent years and a multitude of studies on the subject, the cause and mechanisms underlying the syndrome of angina with normal coronary arteries remain unknown. Indeed, results of investigations are controversial and speculation still prevails regarding the nature of the so called `Syndrome X'. Almost every important aspect of Syndrome X has been tackled in the book and the reader is exposed not only to the cardiologists' opinion, but also to the authoritative views of the gastroenterologists, gynaecologists and psychiatrists, extremely well represented in this monograph. The book deals with `cardiologists' Syndrome X' and not the metabolic entity termed `Syndrome X'. The possible connection between the two, however, is discussed. Angina with Normal Coronary Arteries: Syndrome X contributes to the understanding of Syndrome X and helps clinicians manage their Syndrome X-patients better and investigators to open new avenues for research.",

From insects and birds to reindeer and giant whales, many animals fly, swim, walk, and even hitchhike in search of better food, milder climate, or suitable mate. Some cross entire oceans; a few even circle the globe. These marathon journeys animals take are filled with great tests of physical strength and endurance - as well as danger and sometimes death. In \"\"Animal Migration\"\", learn why animals are compelled to migrate and the various patterns and cycles of their migrations.",

        "summary": "In 1889 William Morris Davis offered in his paper The Rivers and Valleys of Pennsylvania'' an elegant set of arguments for the origin of the ridges and gaps, and went on to propose a model for the drainage development and geomorphic evolution of the Appalachians. His work served to focus the geomorphic community into an intense, extended debate on the nature and fundamental controls of the long-term erosion of the Appalachians. The 100th anniversary of Davis' provocative paper prompted the convening of a symposium to address some of the fundamental questions about the Appalachians, the 1989 Geomorphology Symposium. The theme of this symposium was the geomorphic evolution of the Appalachians. This volume brings together a collection of papers from the symposium, to provide a summary of the current state of knowledge.",

        "summary": "This edition promises to redefine the canon of the study of appellate courts, continuing the comprehensiveness and increasing the depth of the First Edition. This edition of Appellate Courts provides teachers with choices that are suitable for a two- or three-unit course or a seminar. The book permits emphasis on either appellate jurisdiction and practice or on the structural and policy aspects of appellate court organization and administration. All the chapters have been revamped and updated, with coverage of appellate jurisdiction substantially expanded. Using both classic and new cases, the book examines theoretical and practical issues arising from the appellate courts' dual roles to correct trial court error and to generate common law. Its coverage of the dramatic rise in the volume of appeals and the resultant institutional reforms far surpasses that of any other law school course book. Fresh materials present new perspectives on appellate structures, personnel, and procedures--preparing students to practice in the contemporary state and federal appellate courts. This provocative book considers such issues as the delegation of responsibility to law clerks and staff attorneys, the threats to judicial collegiality, the selection of state and federal judges--including the regulation of judicial candidates' speech, and the role and ethics of the appellate lawyer. It devotes a separate chapter to the U.S. Supreme Court's discretionary jurisdiction while another chapter draws upon Professor Meador's unique understanding of the English and German appellate systems to contrast those systems with our own. In short, this book is unique in not only exploring appellate jurisdiction and procedure but also in taking the measure of the appellate courts in all their dimensions as important institutions in the American legal order. The Teacher's Manual also has been updated and greatly expanded to assist both experienced and less-experienced teachers. It includes discussion of the principal cases and secondary materials as well as expert suggestions concerning answers to questions posed in the Notes. It also provides a wealth of supplemental material to bolster any professor's expertise and make it easy for an instructor new to the subject to teach from the book effectively and confidently.",

It examines the city's previous history of social protest, working-class militancy, and leftist activism as an explanation for the particular nature of the dirty war there. Argentina's missing bones examines both national and transnational influences on the counter-revolutionary war in C\u00f3rdoba. The book also considers the legacy of this period and examines the role of the state in constructing a public memory of the violence and holding those responsible accountable through the most extensive trials for crimes against humanity to take place anywhere in Latin America\"--Provided by publisher.",

The astonishingly rapid changes wrought by the industrial -- and American and French -- revolutions led to a wealth of artistic production. This profusely illustrated guide to the arts of the early 19th century on both sides of the Atlantic is the most comprehensive volume available on the subject. Through both famous and obscure works, William Vaughan explores a stunning variety of artistic achievement, including landscape, still life, and figure painting by Gericault, Ingres, Delacroix, Turner, Blake, Constable, Goya, and Friedrich. Vaughan also treats sculpture, architecture, town planning, and photography, and offers an in-depth survey of the decorative arts: furniture, ceramics, glass, metalwork, and more. Drawing on the most up-to-date research, the author brings this exciting period and its inexhaustible artistic production to life.",

        "summary": "\"Combining a Nietzschean framework with close attention to a wide range of carefully selected literary texts, Autoaesthetics presents a case for Nietzche's centrality in contemporary aesthetic and literary studies. Based on Nietzche's own practice of combining poetry and philosophy by transcending ressentiment and approaching life to its fullest, Autoaesthetics engages in a heated but intricate debate through and with Nietzche's re-articulation of the self as a strategic (and impossible) aesthetic creation.\" \"Stephen Barker argues that all notions of self are aesthetic, literary, strategic, and teleological, and must be seen not in the context of any essential self but as a complex series of self-articulations. He sets out a strategy of reading that combines Nietzschean \"psychology\" with subsequent theoretical investigations and shows how Nietzschean dialectics of the self are at work in all (self-defining) human experience in the (post)modern world. His book itself is a play of dialectics (again after Nietzche), designed for interdisciplinary scholars and graduate students interested in exploring the scope of literary and aesthetic theory and philosophy.\"--BOOK JACKET.Title Summary field provided by Blackwell North America, Inc.

        "summary": "A Thorough Guide to Elementary Matrix Algebra and Implementation in R Basics of Matrix Algebra for Statistics with R provides a guide to elementary matrix algebra sufficient for undertaking specialized courses, such as multivariate data analysis and linear models. It also covers advanced topics, such as generalized inverses of singular and rectangular matrices and manipulation of partitioned matrices, for those who want to delve deeper into the subject. The book introduces the definition of a matrix and the basic rules of addition, subtraction, multiplication, and inversion. Later topics include determinants, calculation of eigenvectors and eigenvalues, and differentiation of linear and quadratic forms with respect to vectors. The text explores how these concepts arise in statistical techniques, including principal component analysis, canonical correlation analysis, and linear modeling. In addition to the algebraic manipulation of matrices, the book presents numerical examples that illustrate how to perform calculations by hand and using R. Many theoretical and numerical exercises of varying levels of difficulty aid readers in assessing their knowledge of the material. Outline solutions at the back of the book enable readers to verify the techniques required and obtain numerical answers. Avoiding vector spaces and other advanced mathematics, this book shows how to manipulate matrices and perform numerical calculations in R. It prepares readers for higher-level and specialized studies in statistics.",

        "summary": "This volume examines the use of the image of the Jewish temple in the writings of the Anglo-Saxon theologian and historian, Bede (d. 735). The various Jewish holy sites described in the Bible possessed multiple different meanings for Bede and therefore this imagery provides an excellent window into his thought. Bede's Temple: An Image and its Interpretation examines Bede's use of the temple to reveal his ideas of history, the universe, Christ, the Church, and the individual Christian. Across his wide body of writings Bede presented an image of unity, whether that be the unity of Jew and gentile in the universal Church, or the unity of human and divine in the incarnate Christ, and the temple-image provided a means of understanding and celebrating that unity. Conor O'Brien argues that Bede's understanding of the temple was part of the shared spirituality and communal discourse of his monastery at Wearmouth-Jarrow, in particular as revealed in the great illuminated Bible made there: the Codex Amiatinus. Studying the temple in Bede's works reveals not just an individual genius, but a monastic community engaged actively in scriptural interpretation and religious reflection. O'Brien makes an important contribution to our understanding of early Anglo-Saxon England's most important author, the world in which he lived, and the processes that inspired his work.",

        "summary": "Global agriculture is now at the crossroads. The Green Revolution of the last century is losing momentum. Rates of growth in food production are now declining, with land and water resources becoming scarcer, while world population continues to grow. We need to continue to identify and share the knowledge that will support successful and sustainable agriculture systems. These depend crucially on soil. Gaining international attention, Dr. Uphoff\u2019s efforts to promote and develop sustainable agriculture was recently featured in the N.Y. Times Led by Norman Uphoff, internationally renowned for his proactive approach to world hunger, this volume brings together 102 experts representing 28 nations and multiple disciplines to report on achievements in sustainable soil-system management. While accepting some continuing role for chemical and other external inputs, this book presents ways in which crops can be produced cost effectively in greater abundance with lessened dependence on the exogenous resources that have driven the expansion of agriculture in the past. Including the work of both researchers and practitioners, this important volume \u2014 \u00b7 Explores soil systems in a variety of climate conditions \u00b7 Discusses the importance of symbiotic relationships between plants and soil organisms, looking at crops as integral and interdependent participants in ecosystems \u00b7 Seeks to reduce the distance between scientific research and technical practice \u00b7 Examines related considerations such as pest and disease control, climate change, fertility restoration, and uses of monitoring and modeling With 50 self-contained chapters, this work provides researchers, practitioners, and policy makers with a comprehensive understanding of the science and steps needed to utilize soil systems for the long-term benefit of humankind.

        "summary": "\"A Blake Bibliography \"was first published in 1964. Minnesota Archive Editions uses digital technology to make long-unavailable books once again accessible, and are published unaltered from the original University of Minnesota Press editions. The aim of this book is to list every reference to William Blake published between 1757 and 1863 and every criticism and edition of his works from the beginning to the present. Partly because of the deluge of scholarship in the last forty years, it includes perhaps twice as many titles as Sir Geoffrey Keynes's great bibliography of 1921. An introductory essay on the history of Blake scholarship puts the most significant works into perspective, indicates the best work that has been done, and points to some neglected areas. In addition, all the most important references and many of the less significant ones are briefly annotated as to subject and value. Because many of the works are difficult to locate, specimen copies of all works published before 1831 have been traced to specific libraries. Each of Blake's manuscripts is also traced to its present owner. Two areas which have received relatively novel attention are early references to Blake (before 1863) and important sale and exhibition catalogues of his works. In both areas there are significant number of important entries which have not been noticed before by Blake scholars. The section on Blake's engravings for commercial works receives especially detailed treatment. A few of the titles listed here have not been described previously in connection with Blake.",

Insufficient capital was part of the problem but the author postulates that the factory\u2019s demise was also related to price cutting by the East India Company, a major supplier of chinaware (as well as other goods) to the colonies. The destruction of a local industry by the East India Company only a year before the Tea Act prepared the ground for Pennsylvania\u2019s hostility toward the company in 1773.",

        "summary": "The service life of Virginia's concrete bridge decks is generally controlled by chloride-induced corrosion of the reinforcing steel as a result of the application of winter maintenance deicing salts. A chloride corrosion model accounting for the variable input parameters using Monte Carlo resampling was developed. The model was validated using condition surveys from 10 Virginia bridge decks built with bare steel. The influence of changes in the construction specifications of w/c = 0.47 and 0.45 and w/cm = 0.45 and a cover depth increase from 2 to 2.75 inches was determined. Decks built under the specification of w/cm = 0.45 (using slag or fly ash) and a 2.75 inch cover depth have a maintenance free service life of greater than 100 years, regardless of the type of reinforcing steel. Galvanized, MMFX-2, and stainless steel, in order of increasing reliability of a service life of greater than 100 years, will provide a redundant corrosion protection system. Life cycle cost analyses were conducted for polymer concrete and portland cement based overlays as maintenance activities. The most economical alternative is dependent on individual structure conditions. The study developed a model and computer software that can be used to determine the time to first repair and rehabilitation of individual bridge decks taking into account the time for corrosion initiation, time from initiation to cracking, and time for corrosion damage to propagate to a state requiring repair.",

It provides a lucid and in-depth introduction to the programming language Fortran 77 which is widely used by scientists and engineers.The fourth edition is completely revised chapterwise and also minor corrections incorporated. A new standard for Fortran called Fortran 90 was introduced in early 90s and compilers for this version of Fortran were sold in early 1995 by computer vendors. All Fortran 77 programs will run without change with Fortran 90 compilers; however some aspects of Fortran 77 have been declared obsolete and will not run on future Fortran compilers_these are explained in this revised edition. An appendix consolidates these features. Fortran 90 is introduced in a new chapter which summarises all its features.",

        "summary": "\"Engineers create many of the inventions that shape our society, and as such they play a vital role in determining how we live. This new book does an outstanding job of filling in the knowledge and perspective that engineers must have to be good citizens in areas ranging from the environment, to intellectual property, to ensuring the health of the innovation ecosystem that has done so much for modern society. This is exactly the sort of book that engineers and those who work with them should read and discuss over pizza, coffee, or some other suitable, discussion-provoking consumable.\" John L. Hennessy, president, Stanford University \"Citizen Engineer is the bible for the new era of socially responsible engineering. It's an era where, as the authors show, engineers don't just need to know more, they need to be more. The work is an inspiration, an exhortation, and a practical how-to guide. All engineers concerned with the impact of their work and that should be all engineers must read this book.\" Hal Abelson, professor of computer science and engineering, MIT \"Code is law. Finally, a map to responsible law making. This accessible and brilliant book should be required of every citizen, and especially, the new citizen lawmakers we call engineers.\" Lawrence Lessig, director, Safra Center for Ethics, Harvard University, and cofounder, Creative Commons Being an engineer today means being far more than an engineer. You need to consider not only the design requirements of your projects but the full impact of your work from an ecological perspective, an intellectual property perspective, a business perspective, and a sociological perspective. And you must coordinate your efforts with many other engineers, sometimes hundreds of them. In short, we've entered an age that demands socially responsible engineering on a whole new scale: The era of the Citizen Engineer. This engaging and thought-provoking book, written by computer industry luminaries David Douglas and Greg Papadopoulos, focuses on two topics that are becoming vitally important in the day-to-day work of engineers: eco engineering and intellectual property (IP). Citizen Engineer also examines how and why the world of engineering has changed, and provides practical advice to help engineers of all types master the new era and start thinking like Citizen Engineers.",

        "summary": "This book offers a systematic treatment--the first in book form--of the development and use of cohomological induction to construct unitary representations. George Mackey introduced induction in 1950 as a real analysis construction for passing from a unitary representation of a closed subgroup of a locally compact group to a unitary representation of the whole group. Later a parallel construction using complex analysis and its associated co-homology theories grew up as a result of work by Borel, Weil, Harish-Chandra, Bott, Langlands, Kostant, and Schmid. Cohomological induction, introduced by Zuckerman, is an algebraic analog that is technically more manageable than the complex-analysis construction and leads to a large repertory of irreducible unitary representations of reductive Lie groups. The book, which is accessible to students beyond the first year of graduate school, will interest mathematicians and physicists who want to learn about and take advantage of the algebraic side of the representation theory of Lie groups. Cohomological Induction and Unitary Representations develops the necessary background in representation theory and includes an introductory chapter of motivation, a thorough treatment of the \"translation principle,\" and four appendices on algebra and analysis.",

The account in this book of their activities is therefore not only informative, but critical to understanding recent history.\"---Zbigniew Brzezinski \"The studies and translated Soviet bloc documents published in this book demonstrate the enormous impact of Radio Free Europe, Radio Liberty, and Voice of America during the Cold War. By promoting democratic values and undermining the monopoly of information on which Communist regimes relied, the Radios contributed greatly to the end of the Cold War.\"---George P. Shultz \"I know of no other mass media organization that has done more than RFE/RL to help create the Europe in which we live today---a Europe not divided into two opposing camps.\"---Elena Bonner Examines the role of Western broadcasting to the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe during the Cold War, with a focus on Radio Free Europe and Radio Liberty. It includes chapters by radio veterans and by scholars who have conducted research on the subject in once-secret Soviet bloc archives and in Western records. It also contains a selection of translated documents from formerly secret Soviet and East European archives, most of them published here for the first time.",

        "summary": "Effective policymaking is based on economics which is a blend of empiricism as well as theory. It needs to be grounded not only in data, statistics, and the regularities observed therein, but also analytics, deductive reasoning, and logic, which are the constituents of theory. Published during 2009\u201316, the seven years that Basu spent as a policymaker\u2014first as chief economic adviser to the Government of India and then as chief economist of the World Bank\u2014this volume draws on the work done by empirical economists and is rooted in analytics, even while addressing practical, down-to-earth problems. The papers having a direct bearing on economic policymaking in this quintessential compilation range from topics such as financial regulation, global policy coordination, aspects of the Indian economy like fiscal and monetary policy design, inflation management, food-grain policy and, more generally, the influence of theory on government policymaking. The volume addresses some of the most compelling challenges of our times, from the global financial crisis and sub-prime mortgage breakdown to corruption control and the design of interventions to provide subsidized food to the disadvantaged segments of society.",

        "summary": "The psychologist who pursues an interest in personality is constantly faced by a dilemma. He seeks to investigate what is to him the most intriguing and interesting subject--the multifaceted operations of man in his natural environment. The predicament lies in the discrepancy between the complexity and richness of man's subjective experience, and the pallid analog of these experiences the psychologist is able to study effectively with the research procedures available to him. In Concepts of Personality Joseph M. Wepman and Ralph W. Heine offer a comprehensive survey of classical and contemporary personality theory, including a wide array of examples of these two trends. If the psychologist holds to the premises of strict objectivity through controlled observations, he finds himself driven to the periphery of the very problem he seeks to understand. This is a place where the reliability of measurement and the validity and predictability of his instruments can often be specified, but only at the cost of abandoning the goal of useful generality or of application to the individual in his ordinary life circumstances. Concepts of Personality, unlike most books on the subject, is not limited to broad, general theories. It includes chapters on basic processes--learning, perception, genetics, and drive theory; on the major analytical approaches of psychology and psychiatry; on anthropological and sociological contributions; and on the problems of measurement and assessment. Each chapter is by an authority on the point of view expressed. The editors' introduction, itself a major essay on the complex and divergent patterns and themes of contemporary views of personality, carefully leads the reader through the information at hand. The book as a whole constitutes an encyclopedic summary of the state of the science. Joseph M. Wepman was professor of psychology and surgery and chairman of the Interdepartmental Clinical and Counseling Psychology Training Program of the University of Chicago. He is the author of Recovering from Aphasia and Aphasia and the Family. Ralph W. Heine was professor of psychiatry and psychology and chief clinical psychologist in the department of psychiatry at the University of Chicago. He is the author of The Student Physician as Psychotherapist and Psychotherapy.",

Material presented here naturally divides into two parts, one devoted mainly to real Lie groups, the other to locally compact totally disconnected groups, in particular reductive p-adic groups, or products of real Lie groups and totally disconnected groups. Each part in turn contains roughly three main items: general results on the cohomology used, specific results for cohomology and representations of reductive groups, and applications to discrete cocompact subgroups. This second edition reports on developments in the field since 1980. Annotation copyrighted by Book News, Inc., Portland, OR.",

        "summary": "This book presents a comparative ethnographic understanding of government and low-fee private schools in India within the context of ever-increasing privatization and commercialization of education and the growing presence of non-state actors. Drawing on rich empirical data, the book provides an ethnographic account of a government and a low-fee private school in Hyderabad, India, and explores life in these two distinct spaces through the lens of culture. While private schools catering to the poorer sections have been proliferating, little is known about how these low-fee private schools operate, how choices and negotiations unfold, the classroom discourses, subjective meanings of different stakeholders, and the kind of education provided in these schools vis-\u00e0-vis the government schools. The book focuses on the educational experiences, schooling choices, processes, and voices of the children and teachers at these schools to reflect on how school culture influences the quality of education. Based on intensive fieldwork and qualitative data, the book provides contextual insights into what exactly happens inside the schools and classrooms of two contrasting schooling provisions in India and helps understand the world views of different stakeholders as they negotiate their daily lives. The book will be of interest to students, researchers, and teachers of education, sociology of education, childhood studies, urban education, and teacher education. It will also be useful for education policymakers, educationists, education professionals, and those working on private schooling in India.",

        "summary": "The thrilling tale of Edith O'Gorman was one of the most damaging exposes ever made by an ex-nun. An accomplished lecturer, Edith O'Gorman drew large audiences to hear her talks on the experience of being a nun, and Roman Catholicism in general. O'Gorman's book, which was first published in 1871, narrates the story of her trials and experiences during the 6 years she spent as a Sister of Charity, of her conversion to Protestantism in 1869, of her lectures on Romanism up until 1870 (when she married William Auffrey), Some of the revelations in \"Convent Life Unveiled\" are nothing short of blood-curdling. O'Gorman's book caused quite a stir in her day, selling more than 300,000 copies and nearly costing her life (a failed assassination attempt sent a bullet through her bonnet, barely missing her head). During the 15-year lecture tour she took with her husband, it was claimed that more than 70 attempts were made on their lives. Regardless of the reader's religious persuasion or belief in the veracity of Edith O'Gorman's story, \"Convent Life Unveiled\" offers a fascinating, thought-provoking view of what life in a19th-century convent may very well have been like.",

        "summary": "This study investigated the causes of the excessive delamination and shoving distresses observed in the North Carolina Department of Transportation (NCDOT) Division 13. Two possible causes of these distresses were identified to be: (1) the intermittent purging of the baghouse fines in in-situ asphalt mixes; and (2) improper selection and/or application of the tack coat, i.e., the use of CRS-2 emulsion versus the PG64-22 asphalt binder. Laboratory performance test results on field cores and asphalt mixtures showed that baghouse fines had a stiffening effect on mixtures and these mixtures were more resistant to rutting. However, mixtures containing baghouse fines were found to be moisture-sensitive, with tensile stress ratios below that specified by NCDOT.",

        "summary": "Designing Software Synthesizer Plugins in C++ provides everything you need to know to start designing and writing your own synthesizer plugins, including theory and practical examples for all of the major synthesizer building blocks, from LFOs and EGs to PCM samples and morphing wavetables, along with complete synthesizer example projects. The book and accompanying SynthLab projects include scores of C++ objects and functions that implement the synthesizer building blocks as well as six synthesizer projects, ranging from virtual analog and physical modelling to wavetable morphing and wave-sequencing that demonstrate their use. You can start using the book immediately with the SynthLab-DM product, which allows you to compile and load mini-modules that resemble modular synth components without needing to maintain the complete synth project code. The C++ objects all run in a stand-alone mode, so you can incorporate them into your current projects or whip up a quick experiment. All six synth projects are fully documented, from the tiny SynthClock to the SynthEngine objects, allowing you to get the most from the book while working at a level that you feel comfortable with. This book is intended for music technology and engineering students, along with DIY audio programmers and anyone wanting to understand how synthesizers may be implemented in C++.",

The report presents a brief overview of the project, followed by a detailed description of the APSTRAT model and the considerations that led to its development. The model is discussed in terms of the instructional principles incorporated and the practical constraints accommodated. The data comparing the performance proficiency, academic attrition and recycles, and costs of the conventional and APSTRAT systems indicate that APSTRAT students achieve greater proficiency with a reduction in the rate of academic attrition and a considerable savings in cost.

Jerome Delaney, a professor of educational administration and former high school principal, answers the big questions about education policy in this powerful and practical primer for students. Informed by his experience in the public school system, Delaney takes a pragmatic and realistic approach that divides a complicated subject into manageable sub-topics. He grounds the debate at the classroom level: after all, that\u2019s where the effects of high-level policy decisions ultimately play out. Starting from the basics and progressing through to the deeper aspects of education policy, this text provides an excellent introduction to a subject that lies at the foundation of every education system. This second edition includes a new chapter on issues relating to policy implementation, as well as new discussion questions at the end of each chapter. Topics include: A beginner\u2019s overview of education policy studies. How values influence policy-making. How education policy is developed, implemented, and evaluated. The role of policy in education reform. The future of education policy as schools adapt to changing societies.",

It has been comprehensively updated for the long-awaited C++Beginner\u2019s from the Best selling Programming Author Harry H Chaudhary. The primary aim of this book is to help the reader understand how the facilities offered by C++ support key programming techniques. The aim is to take the reader far beyond the point where he or she gets code running primarily by copying examples and emulating programming styles from other languages. Anyone can learn C++ Programming through This Book I promise. Most Imp. Feature of this book is-- 1) Learn C++ without fear, 2) This book is for everyone, 3) 160 End of book examples, 4) 200 Practical Codes, 5) At last it goes to Expert level topics such as: *Software Design & Development Using C++*, 6) 101 Rules, for Software Design & Development using C++ @ the end of this book. 7) Very Easy Definitions for each topic with code examples and output. While reading this book it is fun and easy to read it. This book is best suitable for first time C++ readers, Covers all fast track topics of C++ for all Computer Science students and Professionals. This book introduces standard C++ and the key programming and design techniques supported by C++. Standard C++ is a far more powerful and polished language than the version of C++ introduced by the first edition of this book. This book presents every major C++ language feature and the standard library. It is organized around language and library facilities. However, features are presented in the context of their use. That is, the focus is on the language as the tool for design and programming rather than on the language in itself. This book demonstrates key techniques that make C++ effective and teaches the fundamental concepts necessary for mastery. As everyone knows that Author Harry is basically known for his Easy way- Programming without fear technique. His book presents world\u2019s easiest definitions and codes for beginners. || Inside Chapters. || 1 (Introduction To C++ Programming) 2 (Inside The C++ Language) 3 (Pointers & References) 4 (Understanding Functions) 5 (Structure-Unions-Enumerated Data Types) 6 (Object Oriented Programming Concept) 7 (C++ Classes and Objects) 8 (Constructors and Destructors) 9 (Operator Overloading) 10 (Console Input / Output Streams) 11 (Inheritance Concept in C++) 12 (Virtual Functions-Polymorphism Concept) 13 (Templates Concept In C++) 14 (Exception Handling In C++) 15 (New Features of ANSI C++ Standard) 16 (Working With Files) 17 (String Classes\u2019) 18 (Your Brain On C++ ( 160 Multiple Choice Questions)) 19 (Your Brain On C++ (100 Practical Programming Questions)) 20 (Software Design & Development Using C++)",

        "summary": "A low-speed wind-tunnel investigation was conducted to study effects of wing-canopy shape on the aerodynamic characteristics and spreader-bar load of a 550 swept parawing having large-diameter leading edges and keel. The canopy-flat-pattern sweep angles investigated on the 550 swept wing were 42.50, 450, 47.50, 500, and 52.50. Several other modifications to the canopy shape were also studied, such as removal of single, double, and compound gores from the rear part of each canopy lobe. A study of the effects of wing-leading-edge sweep angle was made between sweep angles of 500 and 600 and effects of leading-edge diameter were obtained at the basic 550 sweep angle. Effects of keel web height were determined for a constant trailing-edge length and also for trailing-edge lengths that varied with web height.",

        "summary": "Learn Chemical Reaction Engineering through Reasoning, Not Memorization Essentials of Chemical Reaction Engineering is the complete, modern introduction to chemical reaction engineering for today's undergraduate students. Starting from the strengths of his classic Elements of Chemical Reaction Engineering, Fourth Edition, in this volume H. Scott Fogler added new material and distilled the essentials for undergraduate students. Fogler's unique way of presenting the material helps students gain a deep, intuitive understanding of the field's essentials through reasoning, using a CRE algorithm, not memorization. He especially focuses on important new energy and safety issues, ranging from solar and biomass applications to the avoidance of runaway reactions. Thoroughly classroom tested, this text reflects feedback from hundreds of students at the University of Michigan and other leading universities. It also provides new resources to help students discover how reactors behave in diverse situations--including many realistic, interactive simulations on DVD-ROM.New Coverage Includes * Greater emphasis on safety: following the recommendations of the* Chemical Safety Board (CSB), discussion of crucial safety topics, including ammonium nitrate CSTR explosions, case studies of the nitroaniline explosion, and the T2 Laboratories batch reactor runaway* Solar energy conversions: chemical, thermal, and catalytic water spilling* Algae production for biomass* Steady-state nonisothermal reactor design: flow reactors with heat exchange* Unsteady-state nonisothermal reactor design with case studies of reactor explosions About the DVD-ROM The DVD contains six additional, graduate-level chapters covering catalyst decay, external diffusion effects on heterogeneous reactions, diffusion and reaction, distribution of residence times for reactors, models for non-ideal reactors, and radial and axial temperature variations in tubular reactions.Extensive additional DVD resources include * Summary notes, Web modules, additional examples, derivations, audio commentary, and self-tests* Interactive computer games that review and apply important chapter concepts* Innovative Living Example Problems with Polymath code that can be loaded directly from the DVD so students can play with the solution to get an innate feeling of how reactors operate* A 15-day trial of Polymatha is included, along with a link to the Fogler Polymath site* A complete, new AspenTech tutorial, and four complete example problems* Visual Encyclopedia of Equipment, Reactor Lab, and other intuitive tools* More than 500 PowerPoint slides of lecture notes Additional updates, applications, and information are available at www.umich.edu/ essen and www.essentialsofcre.com.",

Expert information of diffusion is itself diffuse, spread over an array of international technical journals and proprietary reports and presented in several languages. This book, written by acknowledged authorities and originally published in the German language, succeeds in providing a comprehensive and detailed treatment of all aspects of extrusion, with special emphasis on the latest advanced technology. Among the extruded metals covered are aluminium, lead, tin, magnesium, zinc, copper. titanium, zirconium, beryllium, uranium, nickel, and steel. Processes discussed include direct and indirect extrusion, cable sheathing by extrusion, hydrostatic extrusion, cladding by extrusion and special technology for extruding various metals. Also discussed are stresses in extrusion, economic aspects, and future developments.",

De een is een diep in de schulden zittende financieel adviseur, die lijdt aan visioenen, de ander een mislukt schilder die naam krijgt met het vervalsen van een uitgerangeerde meester. Er lijkt vooralsnog niets aan de hand, totdat de schimmige mannen plots voor een afgrond komen te staan. Een moment van onachtzaamheid, een misstapje, een onbeduidend toeval en wat zo gevreesd werd, wordt waar. F is een virtuoze roman, vol verwisselingen en geheimzinnigheid, die draait en draait met de werkelijkheid en wat zich daarachter af kan spelen.",

        "summary": "World War II saw the development of the heavy bomber as a decisive weapon which, in sufficient numbers, could overcome defensive fighters and guns and lay waste to strategic targets. The addition of nuclear weapons to the bomber's armament made it even more formidable, and by the late 1940s, US planners saw the growth of a Soviet nuclear-armed bomber fleet as a terrifying threat to North American security. Conventional subsonic fighters with guns and free-flight air-to-air rockets would be incapable of reaching these incoming bombers in time to prevent even one from delivering a devastating nuclear attack. As a result, supersonic speed, long-range guided missiles and precise radar-based control of an interception became prerequisites for a new breed of fighters, beginning with the F-102. A massive research and development effort produced the F-102A '1954 Fighter', the J57 afterburning turbojet, its Hughes MX-1554 fire control system and, in due course, the Semi-Active Ground Environment (SAGE) radar and communications network that covered North America to guide its airborne defences. In service, F-102As also provided air defence in Europe with USAFE, in the Far East and in Southeast Asia, where they protected US airbases in South Vietnam and Thailand from air attack by North Vietnamese fighters and bombers and escorted B-52s and fighter-bombers on their attack sorties. This illustrated study from leading expert Peter E. Davis details the design, development, and deployment of the futuristic F-102, including its complex research program and role in Vietnam.",

        "summary": "The Oxford Movement sprang into life in the 1830s in reaction to the liberalisation of theology and in response to new freedoms for Catholics in society. It was an opportunity for Anglicans who regarded themselves as loyal to Rome, despite the interruption of the Reformation, to promote Catholic theology in the Church of England. A high doctrine of the Church and the sacraments, ritualistic worship and the revival of religious life - plus remarkable social work in slum areas - all characterise what we now call Anglo-Catholicism, still alive and well and accounting for a third of the C of E today. Here the writings of the leading lights of the Oxford Movement are introduced with a useful commentary and explanation.",

        "summary": "You will not find this education at you brokers how to section. Most likely you will not find this information anywhere on this book section on any other book store. I have paid thousands of dollars on exclusive groups and paid forums to collect the information presented in this book. As you can imagine these are the highly guarded secrets of the elite of the FOREX traders, no one gives their living away, unless you pay them a price worth their living. However I have decided to make this information for ridiculously low price, because I am fed up with the brokers and the big banks taking advantage of the regular retail trader. Let me ask you a question? When was the last time you make money with FOREX? Even further more how much money you are willing to lose, until you give up? How long you will continue to give your hard earned money to the broker? Just like you I started 5 years ago with high hopes of quitting my job and leaving the live I deserve with FOREX. My hopes and aspirations were quickly crashed and my dreams went to the dump. First I lost 1000, then 5000, 10k , how much longer I could continue like that, how much longer I could endure the ridicule the jokes of my family and the frown on the face of my wife. It was painful, sitting all day in front of the computer, until you can't see any longer and everything including the platform and your mind become blurry. I know the pain I have been there. This continued for year, until one morning I was ready to quit, I was going to give it a last try and throw that FOREX staff in the garbage, out the window. I stumbled on a rear tread, which since then has been banned, by the broker that was holding the forum. Luckily the tread continued under the broker's radar for while, and gathered a bunch of comments an support. Finally the tread from the trader X was discontinued. I was in dis pare, that was the only hope and light, I have seen for a long time. I was applying the advice from the trade and things were starting to work for me. Fortunately I was able to PM the trader and begged him to agree on a 20 min conversation on the phone. Trader X was not a guru, not your regular internet promoter mojo. He was quietly raking in thousands of dollars a month for years, he was not excited about the next trade, his heart beat was not raising before he pooled the trigger. See, he has been doing this trading staff for so long it has become a boring procedure, rather a morning an afternoon chore, something like putting the garbage out on garbage day. He explained that he learned from the MASTER, I did not proceed to ask him who was the MASTER, since I mainly was concerned with him teaching him every little bit of what he knew about trading. He didn't not agree to spend time teaching me on our first conversation, regardless of how much I offered to pay him. See, for him money was not a issue. Finally on my third approach he agreed to show me what the MASTER had thought him many years ago. What is comprised in the pages of this book will be worth pure gold to you.This book is down to the ground no no sense, real trading knowledge. It gives step by step instructions with real trade examples. This book is not your regular hog wash advice that you will find from your broker and the other magic bullets and seven step series that you see on this site. This book teaches you how to trade like the pros. Shows you how the big banks and foreign nationals and institution trade. The book opens your eyes to how to piggy back on the big institutional traders and win. Ninety Five percent of the people that trade the Forex market lose money and give up. The market is continually replaced by fresh blood like yourself. Don't become part of the statistics, read this book and get a map to success in FOREX. You can make a success in FOREX if you know what you are doing. Yes you can make a living with FOREX and quit your job. You can achieve your dreams. Buy this book and find out How?",

        "summary": "Can you imagine living the dreams of your life, never worrying about money again? What if you can master the game Forex trading, and trade from any place in the world where internet is available? What if all your dreams of leaving the dreaded... J.O.B. become reality...being able to give your family and loved ones the lifestyle they deserve. See, Forex is not for everyone, but is it a legitimate way out of the 9 to 5 rat race. See, as I am writing this introduction for you I am sitting under the bimini of my 51 foot sail boat yacht, in the heart of the Caribbean. Water is crystal turquoise blue, you can see all the way to the bottom.. The colors are incredible. It gives you such of sense of freedom and ability to enjoy life to the fullest. Man paradise, no alarm clocks, no traffic, I can hear the music from the small marina bar. I am not even at the marina, the boat is anchored at a mooring ball. Ha... tell me about the life, that you can have...yeah you can have it too. You need to be sick enough of your same all, same all in order to take action. Do you want trade like the pros, then you have to learn from the pros. You will not find the information in this book anywhere on the Amazon traders section. In a matter of fact no one is teaching what I am about to show you in this book. You would ask, what is so special about it. See, the people that are making a living from Forex are not about to reveal their secrets. The ones that are making money from your trades A . K. A. your friendly broker don't care . In a matter of fact they will gladly offer their friendly education, to teach you how you can too loose a large amount of money like your fellow retail traders that are using the same broker. I am revealing the highly guarded secrets of the big guns. It is possible that I get some ugly letters from traders, and even some of my friends, after this book is released. But heck yeah, I am sick and tired of seeing the daily casualty of honest and hard working people, like yourself loose their hard earned money to the broker. Enough is enough, I have made my stake is time to give back and help others to go the same road. So enough of my blurb... I have laid my hard learned secrets in that book and the price is ridiculously low. You would normally pay 2-3 times more in your local book store, for a book full of BS explaining you, the current economic climate, and how we are coming out of the recession hog wash. Year it says\" learn how to trade\" or something of that effect, but doesn't have even one tenth of the hard core to the bone content I am offering you. See I know you can live and have anything you want in this life. You can even create your own reality. Yeah I know creating you reality is cool, but it requires a \"dirty word\" called work. Do you you want to create your new reality, even step in to it. You would if you knew what is on the other side. Well I decided to create you reality for you. I have done all the dirty work and have set everything up for you for success in this book. So, punch a few buttons and take a click of faith and by this book. I promise you, you will not be disappointed. See you on the other side.",

        "summary": "If you are already making thousands of dollars trading Forex and make a full time extravagant living taking a couple of trades a month, then, please skip this book and go find something else to do.So,on the other side,do you live in a self denial chasing the next best system?STOP...Enough is enough, enough ridicule from your relatives and friends,it's time to show your guts. Face it, think about it, what would youthink if you were on the other side looking through the eyes of your family and friends.All you see is a loser, getting ups and downs totally controlled by the next guru they read about. Doode ,this gota stop! Trust me, I know you feel the pain. I can kind of still remember it...kind of hard to do when I am sitting on my yacht in the Caribbean sipping from something that comes with umbrella on top.See, it didn't use to be that way,not too long, couple of years ago...but I will tell you about that later in my letter Ha!Forex trading is not all it is cracked up to be, it is a hard game controlled by robots and banks and foreign sovereign institutions.Keep reading if you know where I am coming from...Things didn't used to be all pink for me either,pain,loss,closed one losing account,opened second one,heard of such and such broker giving a certain deal on lots opened another account, lost all the money,started in the mini, macro,regular lots...Does that sound familiar,try to look from the outside,Forex is for crazy people, crazy winners or crazy losers. Now,if this is your first contact with Forex,I am really sorry you had to hear this small talk.I would rather be the nice guy,rather be the good news bearer,but please,don't kill the messenger, this is the bloody truth in Forex. You may be mad at me at this moment,but soon will come the moment you will thank me .Or you would rather stumble on a nice guru telling you all the lies, and how he can help you open a 10k account with a secret advantage. Or worseHe can even offer to manage your 10k,if you so willingly send him a check for the whole amount.The book you are about to read is the hard learned secrets of the successful traders and brokers and I am putting it all out for you.See I don't really need the 10 bucks,but I am making sure you appreciate the value you are getting.I have made my share trading the market, paid for all the yachts cars and toys and the farm, now it's your turn.I am sick and tired of the pain in the community and all the retail traders like yourself slaughtered by the hefty brokers.It is time to pay back, it is time for me to give back and to make sure the small trader has evened the plates no more secrets and golden grails uncovered.All the knowledge I am presenting in this book, comes from the school of hard knock, expensive paid Forex forums, where real traders hang out, not bothered by the rookies. Things I overheard on the golf course? Tell me about that, one of the guys I used to golf with executed only one trade a month, we used to call him the \"ONE TRADE GUY\"...How ridiculous that is? Hanging around,playing golf all month until a certain currency goes to a such and such monthly level, and pull the trigger to wipe out all the people with red eyes staring at the screens day and night,fighting with their spouses,wasting their lives in front of the broker platforms.I know what you are thinking \"this guy is full of it!\"Well, I am fed up with the usual story that hits every newbie trader like you and I don't want you to have anything to do with it.So, I am giving you a choice: take this book read it, study and devour every single strategy (however don't choke take it step by step), because it's real, truth coming from a real trader (I wish I could stretch my hand over the monitor,I promise you! You could touch me.)Take the leap of faith;you are a couple mouse clicks away from finding the real freedom and trading like a pro. Take the click of faith! See you on the other side!Trader X",

        "summary": "Ever felt like knocking your boss the eff out? Even if you're your own boss? I have. I remember the day I decided to punch my boss in the face. One of the best decisions I ever made by far. It was glorious. A \"V\" day of sorts. I just walked in his office, looked him straight in the eyes, and did a spinning back fist. Yeah, that's right ... a spinning back fist. Bruce Lee style, baby. I missed of course. And fell. But nevertheless ... my point had been made. I picked myself back up off the floor, slotted back to my cubic-hell, and resumed my daily torchores like a good little drone. And then I woke up. Literally. Like ... in a bed. I was just a stupid dream. \"Man,\" I thought. \"If I can't even punch my boss the right way in my dreams, how the heck am I ever gonna do it in real life?\" So I decided to do what every sensible human being does in his mid-thirties ... give up on my dreams. Luckily for me I had two dreams. One was to punch my boss in the face. The other was to quit my job and get filthy rich doing stuff that made me happy. Swing-and-a-miss on the first dream (pun intended). Home run on the second one. Like ... grand slam home run. I wanna tell you both how I did it and how you can be one of my \"RBI\"s. I've done all the hard work for you. All you have to do is quit your job and come on home. Here's my point ... You can have and do whatever the heck you want. You can, to a certain degree, create your own reality. But it's not easy. Which is why I've decided to create your reality for you. Wanna see it? Step into it even? You would if you knew what was on the other side. All ya gotta do is punch a few buttons and get this book. But you're going to have to take a click of faith.",

        "summary": "Designed to serve as a basic text for introductory courses in public administration, this pioneering work provides students with a clear-eyed understanding of the vital management functions covered in most standard textbooks with two important differences. First, it is written to address the needs of both the experienced practitioner and the entry-level public servant. Case examples bridge the content-rich environment of practitioners with the principles of public administration sought by pre-service students. Second, the discussion of management practices is grounded in the political and ethical tensions inherent in the American constitutional form of governance. This innovative approach reflects the authors' belief that public administration operates as an integral part of the country's political traditions, and thereby helps define the political culture. Key themes in this third edition include: - An emphasis on the ways in which public administration and their agents play a critical role in ensuring legal and political accountability of the political system. - An exploration of local public administration as the backstop of American democracy, requiring a close working partnership between part-time elected officials and career administrators. - Careful examination of the ways in which American political economy requires administrators who are skilled at co-producing the common good with voluntary associations, businesses, nonprofit organizations and other governmental entities. - An understanding that public administration plays a critical role with its prudential judgments in balancing the competing values necessary to secure a regime of ordered liberty. Every chapter has been thoroughly updated, with particular attention paid to chapters on budgeting and revenue, e-government and the digital divide, shared power and the rise of 'wicked problems, ' and the future of public administration in the United States amidst deep polarization. Foundations of Public Service, 3rd Edition provides a framework for understanding American political traditions and how they inform public administration as a political practice. It is required reading for all introductory Public Administration courses with an emphasis on practice and real-world applications.",

        "summary": "GPCR Signaling in Cancer, Volume 145, the latest release in the Advances in Cancer Research series, highlights recent developments in the area of GPCRs and cancer biology. Chapters included in this volume cover several GPCRs and their downstream effectors as case examples to highlight their fundamental understanding and therapeutic potential. Specific chapters address the Role of GRKs and beta-arrestins in cancer, Atypical GPCRs in cancer, the Role of a chemokine receptor (CCR) 5 in cancer, Targeting G protein-coupled receptors for therapeutics in cancer, Emerging GPCR signaling pathways in cancer, and more. G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) constitute a large family of cell surface receptors which are involved in nearly every cellular and physiological event. These receptors can recognize a broad array of ligands and they are targeted by nearly one third of the currently prescribed drugs including anti-cancer therapeutics. Covers the latest concepts in GPCR signaling and their relevancy to cancer biology Presents new indications for anti-cancer therapeutic programs Includes sections on cross-talk and signaling networks of GPCRs and effectors in molecular oncology and therapeutics",

        "summary": "GRPANL is a general-purpose peak-fitting program that calculates gamma-ray and x-ray energies and intensities from a given spectral region. The program requires that the user supply input information such as the first and last channels of the region, the channels to be used as pre- and post-region background, the system gain and zero-intercept, and a list of approximate energy values at which peaks occur in the region. Because the peak position and peak-shape parameters enter nonlinearly into the peak-fitting algorithm, an iterative least-square procedure is used in the fitting process. The program iterates until either all convergence criteria are met or ten iterations have elapsed. The code described here allows for twenty free parameters and a region as large as 240 data channels. This code runs on an LSI-11 computer with 32K memory and disk-storage capability.",

The symposium continued the interdisciplinary character and comprehensive approach of the preceding six symposia. Gaseous DielecIries VII is a detailed record of the symposium proceedings. It covers recent advances and developments in a wide range of basic, applied and industrial areas of gaseous dielectrics. It is hoped that Gaseous DielecIries VII will aid future research and development in, and encourage wider industrial use of, gaseous dielectrics. The Organizing Committee of the Seventh International Symposium on Gaseous Dielectrics consisted of G. Addis (U. S. A. ), L. G. Christophorou (U. S. A. ), F. Y. Chu (Canada), A. H. Cookson (U. S.

Consequently, understanding Generation X\u2014and the potential impact of the independent, sometimes rebellious spirit that characterizes it\u2014is critical. In Generation X Professors Speak: Voices from Academia, Elwood Watson has assembled a unique collection of thematically arranged essays by academics that offers insights into the issues, conflicts, and triumphs that epitomize this often overlooked generation. The essays cover topics ranging from career, class, family life, health, music, and physical disabilities to race, religion, and sexuality. Together, the essays define the characteristics and demonstrate the diversity of Generation X, and will appeal to scholars, students, and others interested in social history, psychology, gender studies, and popular culture.",

        "summary": "The aim of this book is to unlock the power of the freeware R language to advanced university students and researchers dealing with whole-rock geochemistry of (meta-) igneous rocks. The first part covers data input/output, calculation of commonly used indexes and plotting in R. The core of the book then focusses on the presentation and practical implementations of modelling techniques used for fingerprinting processes such as partial melting, fractional crystallization, binary mixing or AFC using major-, trace-element and radiogenic isotope data. The reader will be given a firm theoretical basis for forward/reverse modelling, followed by exercises dealing with typical problems likely to be encountered in real life, and their solutions using R. The concluding sections demonstrate, using practical examples, how a researcher can proceed in developing a realistic model simulating natural systems. The appendices outline the fundamentals of the R language and provide a quick introduction to the open-source R-package GCDkit for interpretation of whole-rock geochemical data from igneous and metamorphic rocks.",

        "summary": "A literary treasure of over one hundred unpublished letters from National Book Award-winning author Flannery O'Connor and her circle of extraordinary friends. Flannery O\u2019Connor is a master of twentieth-century American fiction, joining, since her untimely death in 1964, the likes of Hawthorne, Hemingway, and Faulkner. Those familiar with her work know that her powerful ethical vision was rooted in a quiet, devout faith and informed all she wrote and did. Good Things Out of Nazareth, a much-anticipated collection of many of O\u2019Connor\u2019s previously unpublished letters\u2014along with those of literary luminaries such as Walker Percy (The Moviegoer), Caroline Gordon (None Shall Look Back), Katherine Anne Porter (Ship of Fools), Robert Giroux and movie critic Stanley Kauffmann. The letters explore such themes as creativity, faith, suffering, and writing. Brought together, they form a riveting literary portrait of these friends, artists, and thinkers. Here we find their joys and loves, as well as their trials and tribulations as they struggle with doubt and illness while championing their beliefs and often confronting racism in American society during the civil rights era. Praise for Good Things Out of Nazareth \u201cAn epistolary group portrait that will appeal to readers interested in the Catholic underpinnings of O'Connor's life and work . . . These letters by the National Book Award\u2013winning short story writer and her friends alternately fit and break the mold. Anyone looking for Southern literary gossip will find plenty of barbs. . . . But there\u2019s also higher-toned talk on topics such as the symbolism in O\u2019Connor\u2019s work and the nature of free will.\u201d\u2014Kirkus Reviews \u201cA fascinating set of Flannery O\u2019Connor\u2019s correspondence . . . The compilation is highlighted by gems from O\u2019Connor\u2019s writing mentor, Caroline Gordon. . . . While O\u2019Connor\u2019s milieu can seem intimidatingly insular, the volume allows readers to feel closer to the writer, by glimpsing O\u2019Connor\u2019s struggles with lupus, which sometimes leaves her bedridden or walking on crutches, and by hearing her famously strong Georgian accent in the colloquialisms she sprinkles throughout the letters. . . . This is an important addition to the knowledge of O\u2019Connor, her world, and her writing.\u201d\u2014Publishers Weekly",

Labourers engaged in jobs which require extensive lifting/lowering, carrying and pushing/pulling of heavy materials have suffered increasing rates of musculo-skeletal injury, especially to the back.; This guide is intended to include all activities involved in MMH lifting, pushing, pulling, carrying and holding. Recommendations are provided in the form of design data that can be used to design different MMH work activities. The guide is divided into two parts. Part I outlines the scope of the problem, discusses the factors that influence a person's capacity to perform MMH activities and / or should be modified to reduce the risk of injuries, and reviews the various design approaches to solving the MMH problem. Part II provides specific design data in six distinct chapters. The seventh chapter of Part II of the guide describes various mechanical devices that are available to aid MMH activities.; The guide is aimed at all concerned with the health impact of MMH activities; occupational health and safety workers; senior human resource managers; ergonomists; workers' compensation lawyers; union representatives.",

Haiti's impact on the United States, including voodoo economics, and the effects of U.S. embargoes against the country are discussed along with plausible reasons for occupation.",

        "summary": "To what extent have Hollywood feature films shaped the meanings that Americans attach to alcoholics, their families, and the alcoholic condition? To what extent has the mass culture of the movie industry itself been conceptually shaped by a broad, external societal discourse? Norman Denzin brings to his life-long study of alcoholism a searching interest in how cultural texts signify and lend themselves to interpretation within a social nexus. Both historical and diachronic in his approach, Denzin identifies five periods in the alcoholism films made between 1932 and the end of the 1980s, and offers a detailed critical reading of thirty-seven films produced during these six decades. \"Professor Denzin has produced a searching and provocative interpretation of more than a half-century of Hollywood's social and personal construction of the problem drinker in America. Readable by both lay persons and specialists, Denzin's book provides us with the most comprehensive understanding of this topic to date.\"--Stanford M. Lyman, Robert J. Morrow Eminent Scholar in Social Science, Florida Atlantic University \"An eminent sociologist and leading authority on alcoholism, Denzin also writes skillfully about films as films and is comfortable with postmodern interpretive theory\u00e0a genuinely interdisciplinary work of the first order.\" --Robert L. Carringer, author, The Making of Citizen Kane \"Denzin has gone on an exhaustive bar-crawl through hundreds of movies, returning with evidence that the film about drinking is a genre of its own. He writes from sound knowledge about alcoholism--which, unlike other diseases, is frequently viewed with bittersweet romanticism.\"--Roger Ebert Norman K. Denzin is professor of sociology, cinema studies, and interpretive theory at the University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign. He was awarded the George Herbert Mead Award for Lifetime Achievement from the Society for the Study of Symbolic Interaction. He is the author of several books, including Screening Race: Hollywood and a Cinema of Racial Violence, The Recovering Alcoholic, Interpretive Ethnography, Images of Postmodernism: Social Theory and Contemporary Cinema, and Interpretive Interactionism.",

        "summary": "Cardiac outputs of seminude resting male subjects were estimated from measurements of transthoracic impedance pulses as recorded by the tetropolar impedance plethysmographic technic. Ambient temperature was increased from 28 to 43C and maintained at this level for 1.5-2.0 hours. Increases in cardiac output were small, variable (ranging from 0.3 to 1.8 liters/min.), and were caused by small increases both in heart rate and stroke volume. The greater cardiac output was temporally related more closely to the augmented stroke volume which was, in turn, closely related to cutaneous vadodilatation as demonstrated by the cutaneous opacity pulses, the implication being that the augmented stroke volume probably results from the greater cutaneous venous return. The ratio of increase in cardiac output to sweating was about the same as previously shown; changes in oral temperature were small in all subjects, averaging about 0.5F. Validation of the electrical impedance technic as a measure of right ventricular stroke output was accomplished in dogs through comparisons of pulmonary arterial blood flow (electromagnetic flowmeter) and dye dilution (cardiogreen) cardiac output with that obtained by the impedance method. The correlations between the three methods were 0.792 and 0.916, respectively. (Author).",

Nearly 100 states have accepted the United Nations Covenants of 1966; regional systems of human rights are in operation in Europe, Africa and Latin America; and organisations such as the ILO and Unesco have their own instruments and procedures. \"Human Rights in the World\" explains what the current guarantees of human rights are and how they work. Substantially rewritten and updated to take into account the ending of the Cold War, this new edition includes such issues as the War Crimes Tribunal for Former Yugoslavia, the Convention on the Rights of the Child and the role of the UN Commissioner for Human Rights. Authoritative, comprehensive and up-to-date, the book is an invaluable source of reference for students, scholars and practitioners.",

The purpose of this report is to collate the large amount of hydrographic, nutrient, and plankton data generated from various investigators on this cruise and use the report as a standard for the cruise participants. Data for temperature, salinity, oxygen, nitrate, nitrite, ammonium, phosphate, silicate, chlorophyll a, productivity indices, and carbon fixation rates are given. (Author).",

The movement is too bound up in polarizing ideologies that pit humans against nature, conservation against development, and government regulation against economic growth. Only when we acknowledge the infinite perspectives on how people should relate to nature will we forge solutions that are respectful to both humanity and the environment.\" \"Infinite Nature opens doors so that nature can be seen from the scientific understandings proffered by anthropology, evolution, and ecology, to the promise of environmental responsibility offered by technology and economics, to the designs of nature envisioned in philosophy, art, law, and religion. Along the way, Hull helps us find the common ground created out of many natures - the place where sustainable and thriving communities are possible.\"--BOOK JACKET",

Angela Douglas distills the vast literature in entomology and microbiology, as well as the burgeoning microbiome literature, to explore the full scope of insect-microbial interactions and their applications to real-world problems in agriculture and medicine. Douglas investigates how insects acquire and support their microbial partners, and examines how microorganisms contribute to insect nutrition, the defense against natural enemies, and the detoxification of natural allelochemicals and chemical insecticides. She analyzes how beneficial microbes can be harnessed to solve real-world problems in insect pest management, including strategies to suppress the transmission of viruses and microbial disease agents by mosquitoes and other insects. She also addresses the use of insects as biomedical models for effective microbial therapies treating a range of chronic human diseases, and considers how knowledge of insect-microbial interactions can promote the health of beneficial insects, especially in the context of environmental pollutants and climate change. Insects and Their Beneficial Microbes provides a much-needed conceptual framework for the growing discipline of insect-microbial interactions, and offers a wealth of insights into insect symbioses from molecular, physiological, ecological, and evolutionary perspectives.",

        "summary": "Computational techniques based on simulation have now become an essential part of the statistician's toolbox. It is thus crucial to provide statisticians with a practical understanding of those methods, and there is no better way to develop intuition and skills for simulation than to use simulation to solve statistical problems. Introducing Monte Carlo Methods with R covers the main tools used in statistical simulation from a programmer's point of view, explaining the R implementation of each simulation technique and providing the output for better understanding and comparison. While this book constitutes a comprehensive treatment of simulation methods, the theoretical justification of those methods has been considerably reduced, compared with Robert and Casella (2004). Similarly, the more exploratory and less stable solutions are not covered here. This book does not require a preliminary exposure to the R programming language or to Monte Carlo methods, nor an advanced mathematical background. While many examples are set within a Bayesian framework, advanced expertise in Bayesian statistics is not required. The book covers basic random generation algorithms, Monte Carlo techniques for integration and optimization, convergence diagnoses, Markov chain Monte Carlo methods, including Metropolis {Hastings and Gibbs algorithms, and adaptive algorithms. All chapters include exercises and all R programs are available as an R package called mcsm. The book appeals to anyone with a practical interest in simulation methods but no previous exposure. It is meant to be useful for students and practitioners in areas such as statistics, signal processing, communications engineering, control theory, econometrics, finance and more. The programming parts are introduced progressively to be accessible to any reader.",

An understanding of real analysis is necessary for the study of advanced topics in mathematics and the physical sciences, and is helpful to advanced students of engineering, economics, and the social sciences. Stoll, who teaches at the U. of South Carolina, presents examples and counterexamples to illustrate topics such as the structure of point sets, limits and continuity, differentiation, and orthogonal functions and Fourier series. The second edition includes a self-contained proof of Lebesgue's theorem and a new appendix on logic and proofs. Annotation copyrighted by Book News Inc., Portland, OR",

        "summary": "First developed in the princely courts of Renaissance Italy in the 1430s, in the 16th century medals were transformed into a recognisably modern form, in the messages they conveyed, the techinques employed in their manufacture, and the uses to which they were put. Contributing to this change were influential patrons including the Medici and the popes, as well as celebrated artists such as Leone Leoni and Benvenuto Cellini. This catalogue takes up the story where Sir George Hill's classic Corpus of Italian Medals of the Renaissance before Cellni published in 1930, leaves off. This major catalogue includes over 1200 medals from the British Museum and the other major British collections, many published here for the first time. The catalogue entries provide detailed historical and iconographical information on the medals, many of which are published for the first time. The introductory essays discuss the centres of production, artists and subjects of the medals; the reasons they were made; their design, production and functions; the diffusion of the Italian medal throughout Europe in the 16th century and the history of collecting 16th-century Italian medals in Britain.",

        "summary": "J. Hillis Miller is undoubtedly one of the most important literary critics of the past century. For well over five decades his work has been at the forefront of theoretical and philosophical thinking and writing. From his earliest work with Georges Poulet and the so-called Geneva School, which introduced a generation of North American critics to the concept of a phenomenological literary hermeneutic, to a deconstructive rhetorical philology and an ethically motivated textual analysis, Miller's readings have not only reflected major movements in literary theory, they have also created them.Surprisingly, Eamonn Dunne's J. Hillis Miller and the Possibilities of Reading is the first book devoted exclusively to examining Miller's work. Dunne argues that an appreciation of Miller is crucial to an informed understanding about the radical changes occurring in critical thinking in the humanities in recent years. This book, the first of its kind, will be a vital and enabling avenue for further research into J. Hillis Miller's exemplary and prolific output.",

Krishnamurti (1895\u20131986) continues to transform thought, lifestyles, and education across continents more than three decades after his death. In this new biography, tracing the nine long decades of his life, from his growing-up years, his relationships to his writings and talks, Roshen Dalal provides a much-needed corrective \u2013 an objective and balanced view of his legacy. Adopted by Theosophists at the age of fourteen, and proclaimed a world teacher and messiah, in 1929, Krishnamurti dissolved the Order of the Star created for him and went on to develop his own philosophy. What is it about his ideas that draws the following of generations of people? Delivered to a divided world then, what makes his message so relevant now? While his ideas on education are idealistic, why do they continue to be everlasting in their contribution and appeal? Krishnamurti\u2019s vision is of a world without boundaries or wars, a world where compassion and goodness predominate, and his message is that such a world can be arrived at only through individual transformation.B24 There is no direct path to transformation, yet through intense perception and understanding, it is possible to achieve this goal. Carefully reconstructing the events and extracting the essence of his talks, Dalal dispels several myths, explains his teachings, and reveals the underlying theosophical and occult influence in Krishnamurti\u2019s life. Here is the most complete biography yet, of one of the greatest thinkers of the twentieth century.",

        "summary": "Is Japan on a path towards assuming a greater military role internationally, or has the recent military normalisation ground to a halt since the premiership of Junichiro Koizumi? In this book, Christopher W. Hughes assesses developments in defence expenditure, civilmilitary relations, domestic and international militaryindustrial complexes, Japans procurement of regional and global power-projection capabilities, the expansion of USJapan cooperation, and attitudes towards nuclear weapons, constitutional revision and the use of military force. In all of these areas, dynamic and long-term changes outweigh Japans short-term political logjam over security policy. Hughes argues that many post-war constraints on Japans military role are still eroding, and that Tokyo is moving towards a more assertive military role and strengthened USJapan cooperation. Japans remilitarisation will boost its international security role and the dominance of the USJapan alliance in regional and global security affairs, but will need to be carefully managed if it is not to become a source of destabilising tensions.",

        "summary": "Until 1860 John Ruskin's writings were primarily about art and architecture; but his belief that good art can flourish only in a society that is sound and healthy led him inevitably to a preoccupation with social and economic problems, the dominant concern of his later writings. James Clark Sherburne provides in this volume a detailed and long overdue re-examination of Ruskin's social and economic perceptions and, for the first time, systematically places these perceptions in their nineteenth-century intellectual context. Ruskin's eloquence and the strength of his moral, aesthetic, and social convictions established him as one of the most influential of Victorian writers. His writings, however, are not easily categorized and many of his important insights occur as digressions in discussions of other topics. Mr. Sherburne succeeds in ordering and clarifying the rich chaos of Ruskin's social thought without denying that wholeness which is, paradoxically, its salient feature. He discovers the source of Ruskin's social criticism in his early writings. He then follows Ruskin's interest as it shifts from economic theory to the problems of exploitation, war, imperialism, the means of social reform, and the construction of the welfare state. Ruskin's remarkably early vision of the possibility of economic abundance, his anticipation of its social and personal implications, his much disparaged critique of classical economics, his pioneering attention to the role of the consumer and the quality of consumption, his anxious portrayal of the effects of industrialism on the environment, his critique of English educational methods, and his farsighted proposals for public management of industry and transport are among the many aspects of Ruskin's thought examined by Mr. Sherburne. What emerges is an original and exhaustive study of a dimension of Ruskin's work which, though much neglected, is particularly relevant to contemporary concerns.",

        "summary": "John X\u00e1ntus was a bit of a charlatan; of that there is little doubt. He lied about his exploits, joined the U.S. Army under an assumed name, and managed to alienate most of the people he met. Yet this Hungarian immigrant became one of the Smithsonian Institution\u2019s most successful collectors of natural history specimens in the mid-nineteenth century, and he is credited with the discovery of many new species in the American West. From his station at Ft. Tejon in California\u2019s Tehachapi Mountains, X\u00e1ntus carried on a lengthy correspondence with Spencer Baird at the Smithsonian, to whom he shipped the specimens he had trapped or shot in the surrounding sierra and deserts. A prolific letter writer, X\u00e1ntus faithfully reported his findings as he bemoaned his circumstances and worried about his future. Working from Smithsonian archives, natural history writer Ann Zwinger has assembled X\u00e1ntus\u2019s unpublished letters into a book that documents his trials and triumphs in the field and reveals much about his dubious character. The letters also bring to life a time and place on the western frontier from which X\u00e1ntus was able to observe a broad panorama of American history in the making. Zwinger\u2019s lively introduction sets the stage for X\u00e1ntus\u2019s correspondence and examines the apparent contradictions between the man\u2019s personal and professional lives. Her detailed notes to the letters further clarify his discoveries and shed additional light on his checkered career.",

        "summary": "K-Wiring: Principles and Techniques Kirschner wires or K-wires are sterilized, sharpened, smooth stainless steel pins/wires used in orthopedic surgery as implants. K-wire implants are extremely versatile in their usage and can treat fractures of various kinds in most of the bones from finger tips to toes. Due to their remarkable ability to heal and reconstruct intricate bone fractures, they are a popular choice among orthopedic surgeons the world over. Each reconstruction is an innovation in itself, as every complex fracture presents its unique challenges. There is a paucity of literature on standard techniques, principles and approaches to be employed for K-wiring fractures. This book fills that gap. It is the first of its kind in demonstrating the effective execution of K-wiring procedures through a lucid, case-based format. It serves as a practical guide for orthopedic surgeons on K-wiring techniques, thus enabling them to improve patient care. It will be an invaluable reference text not just for practicing orthopedic surgeons but also for subspecialists like consultant hand surgeons, foot and ankle surgeons, and microvascular plastic hand surgeons, helping them master the operative techniques related to K-wiring. Salient features: Detailed coverage of latest techniques and procedures for operating fractures with the help of K-wires Thorough descriptions of complexities encountered in all regions of the body Discussion of many cases with their management protocols Guidance for correcting mismanaged cases by using K-wires Use of excellent quality images with textual description that facilitate better relatability Extensive use of original patient photographs, radiographs, and skillfully created illustrations",

        "summary": "These notes are based on the course of lectures I gave at Harvard in the fall of 1964. They constitute a self-contained account of vector bundles and K-theory assuming only the rudiments of point-set topology and linear algebra. One of the features of the treatment is that no use is made of ordinary homology or cohomology theory. In fact, rational cohomology is defined in terms of K-theory.The theory is taken as far as the solution of the Hopf invariant problem and a start is mode on the J-homomorphism. In addition to the lecture notes proper, two papers of mine published since 1964 have been reproduced at the end. The first, dealing with operations, is a natural supplement to the material in Chapter III. It provides an alternative approach to operations which is less slick but more fundamental than the Grothendieck method of Chapter III, and it relates operations and filtration. Actually, the lectures deal with compact spaces, not cell-complexes, and so the skeleton-filtration does not figure in the notes. The second paper provides a new approach to K-theory and so fills an obvious gap in the lecture notes.",

The operational history section includes examples from the Classes Type VIIA, Type VIIB, VIID, VIIE and VIIF before concentrating on the mainstay of the U-boat arm, the Type VIIC.

        "summary": "Language is the medium in which we humans compose our thoughts, explain our thinking, construct our arguments, and create works of literature. Without language, societies as complex as ours could not exist. Geoffrey Pullum offers a stimulating introduction to the many ways in which linguistics, as the scientific study of language, matters. With its close relationships to psychology, education, philosophy, and computer science, the subject has a compelling human story to tell about the ways in which different societies see and describe the world, and its far-reaching applications range from law to medicine and from developmental psychology to artificial intelligence. Introducing Polity\u2019s Why It Matters series: In these short and lively books, world-leading thinkers make the case for the importance of their subjects and aim to inspire a new generation of students.",

She realizes too late that she is losing her abilities. While she, Lee, and her fellow paranormal investigators are on a case taking them to a remote island in Micronesia, a chain of events she's unable to shield herself against overwhelms her. Her mind becomes flooded with memories that aren't her own. What are they trying to show her? Who's the man who keeps reappearing in her vivid dreams? And why can't she protect herself from being temporarily possessed?When she and the rest of the team reach the island where a Japanese World War II ghost ship had run aground, Hayley wonders if she still has the ability to speak to the dead, to solve the mystery of why the remains of Americans were found on board with no sign of the Japanese crew, and if she is able to discover who has created a portal, opening a door between dimensions, allowing the ship to create its own atmosphere, and repairs it rusted hull.Hayley is surprised to find that all the mysteries she'd experienced are linked and shocked to learn that she's responsible.",

It has been a long journey for the boy from Kincasslagh, County Donegal, and in Living the Dream he tells his story with his customary sense of humour and down-to-earth charm. Much has happened in Daniel O'Donnell's life since his first autobiography, Follow Your Dream, and in this new book he reflects on the range of experiences and emotions that accompanied his wife Majella's battle with cancer; the death of his beloved mother, Julia; his part in the BBC's Strictly Come Dancing TV show; and his B&B Road Trip adventures with Majella. And he delves into the relentless touring and recording that took him to the brink of burnout and forced him to reassess his priorities. Daniel O'Donnell is an international phenomenon \u2013 'a real star'. His fans will love this latest instalment of his extraordinary life story.",

There are sections on paper folding, dissections, curve stitching, linkages, the drawing of loci and envelopes and the construction of plane tessellations. The volume is fully illustrated with diagrams and photographs of models in paper and other materials and all have been successfully made and tested. Note, for books that provide the nets and instructions to make various solids, look at Make Shapes 1, Make Shapes 2, and Paper Polyhedra in Colour. Cundy and Rollett provides both a wider range of nets but not in ready-made form.",

Corcoran and Fischer have revised this edition to reflect new research and contemporary clinical practices. They include new scales and materials in areas such as assessment in culturally diverse populations and measurement in managed care systems, as well as the best instruments updated from the previous editions. Brief and easy to administer, these \"best practice measures\" will be useful for all types of therapeutic and theoretical orientations. All instruments are actually reprinted in the book, and are carefully introduced and evaluated to aid in their selection. Corcoran and Fischer explain the principles of measurement and how to apply them in practice.",

        "summary": "Monetary and Financial Integration in West Africa details the progress, challenges faced, and potential of the project intended to create a West African Monetary Zone (WAMZ) between Gambia, Ghana, Guinea, Nigeria and Sierra Leone. Given the trend towards regionalization of economic ties across the world, especially after the successful launch of the euro, a detailed analysis of the WAMZ is needed. As this is the first book on monetary and financial integration in Gambia, Ghana, Guinea, Nigeria and Sierra Leone, it is an essential read for anyone interested in economic development in West Africa, and indeed in Africa as a whole. This book is extremely well-researched, with detail on virtually all aspects of economic integration in the region; with issues ranging from the institutional details of integration, trade and financial market integration, to progress on convergence of macroeconomic fundamentals to the required payments system infrastructure. The book deploys solid empirical facts and sophisticated analyses to thoroughly defend its assertions. This collection is a valuable contribution and an excellent companion book for monetary economics or international economics classes as well as African development literature. It will provide students and researchers with an exciting chance to apply concepts of, for example, optimum currency areas, central bank structure or monetary policy approaches, to a real-world case of potential monetary union. Dr. Temitope W. Oshikoya and his collaborators have written the authoritative book on the subject of monetary union in the West African Monetary Zone. As is evident in the level of detail of the book, Dr. Oshikoya brings rich field experience from his role as Director General and CEO of the West African Monetary Institute. This book will be of interest to postgraduates and researchers in development economics; as well as policymakers, monetary authorities and development practitioners.",

        "summary": "For more than twenty-five years, Mothering magazine has captured an audience of educated women who appreciate its \"we'll inform, you choose\" approach to parenting. Having a Baby, Naturally reflects this spirit with straightforward, uncensored information about pregnancy and childbirth, addressing common concerns and questions in a compassionate, nonjudgmental style. Written by Peggy O'Mara, the longtime publisher, editor, and owner of Mothering magazine, it synthesizes the best theories and safest practices used in natural childbirth, including recommendations from the World Health Organization, the American Academy of Pediatrics, and the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists. Throughout, O'Mara reinforces her belief that each woman's pregnancy and birth experience is a one-of-a-kind event. She covers such topics as: Nutrition, diet, and exercise Emotional self-awareness during and after pregnancy A trimester-by-trimester guide to what is happening in your body and your child's Birth choices -- offering suggestions, not \"rules\" Pain medication alternatives Birth locations, from hospitals to home birth Relieving morning sickness with natural remedies Prenatal testing Breastfeeding Prematurity and multiple births Balancing work and family The father's role during pregnancy and beyond Difficult subjects, such as birth defects, miscarriages, and postpartum depression, are also treated with sensitivity and candor. Finally, a book for the thinking woman who believes in her own inherent capacity to make smart, informed decisions about her pregnancy and birth, just as she makes in other areas of her life. Having a Baby, Naturally is a celebration of childbirth and an accurate and objective guide to helping women fortify their spirits, develop trust in their bodies, and make the best possible choices to protect their new baby's health.",

In Movies, Songs, and Electric Sound, Charles O\u2019Brien examines American and European musical films created circa 1930, when the world\u2019s sound-equipped theaters screened movies featuring recorded songs and filmmakers in the United States and Europe struggled to meet the artistic and technical challenges of sound production and distribution. The presence of singers in films exerted special pressures on film technique, lending a distinct look and sound to the films\u2019 musical sequences. Rather than advancing a film\u2019s plot, songs in these films were staged, filmed, and cut to facilitate the singer\u2019s engagement with her or his public. Through an examination of the export market for sound films in the early 1930s, when German and American companies used musical films as a vehicle for competing to control the world film trade, this book delineates a new transnational context for understanding the Hollywood musical. Combining archival research with the cinemetric analysis of hundreds of American, German, French, and British films made between 1927 and 1934, O\u2019Brien provides the historical context necessary for making sense of the aesthetic impact of changes in film technology from the past to the present.",

        "summary": "This anthology pays tribute to Allan Berube (1946-2007), a self-taught historian and MacArthur Fellow who was a pioneer in the study of lesbian and gay history in the United States. Best known for his Lambda Literary Award-winning book Coming Out Under Fire: The History of Gay Men and Women in World War II (1990), Berube also wrote extensively on the history of sexual politics in San Francisco and on the relationship between sexuality, class, and race. John D'Emilio and Estelle Freedman, who were close colleagues and friends of Berube, have selected sixteen of his most important essays, including hard-to-access articles and unpublished writing. The book provides a retrospective on Berube's life and work while it documents the emergence of a grassroots lesbian and gay community history movement in the 1970s and 1980s. Taken together, the essays attest to the power of history to mobilize individuals and communities to create social change.",

        "summary": "The Pre-K\u2013Grade 12 Gifted Education Programming Standards should be part of every school district\u2019s repertoire of standards to ensure that the learning needs of advanced students are being met. The new edition of this popular book helps schools understand the updates to the standards, which have a renewed emphasis on equity and inclusion. The six standards focus on student outcomes in learning and development, assessment, curriculum planning and instruction, learning environments, programming, and professional learning (updated from professional development used in the 2010 version). This book details these standards and provides suggestions for implementing each one. It also includes sample assessments of student products and performances, which will assist schools in developing program and service evaluation benchmarks. This book is a must-have for school leaders and gifted education professionals who want to offer the most effective services for gifted and advanced students. It is a service publication of the National Association for Gifted Children (Washington, DC). This designation indicates that this book has been jointly developed with NAGC and that this book passes the highest standards of scholarship, research, and practice.",

Thus the only way to treat the historical bases for their development is to begin with Proto-Indo-European. In order to make a reconstructed language like Proto-Indo-European intelligible and intellectually defensible, Sihler presents some of the basis for reconstructing its features and, in the process, discusses reasoning and methodology of reconstruction (including a weighing of alternative reconstructions).",

Lefrancois is known for his friendly, student-oriented writing, which includes personal anecdotes that bring the material to life in a unique and involving way. The author stresses the application of the concepts of developmental psychology to students' career and educational goals. A major emphasis in the new edition is the importance of the contexts (relationship) within which children develop, with special attention to cross-cultural and multicultural issues. The new edition represents a major rethinking of the text with five new emphases, as well as a thorough updating throughout the text.",

The long-term demographic and economic projections produced by this study are to be used in planning the comprehensive development of the Basin's water and related land resources, so that emerging needs can be met in a timely and efficient manner. This survey thus constitutes a basic building block for one of the so-called framework studies of the country's major river basins. As such, it is meant to set quantitative benchmarks or guides for a series of more detailed field surveys of individual tributary drainage areas of the Ohio River Basin which will follow and complement the framework study.

        "summary": "Based on the ideas of Russian psychologists Lev Vygotsky and Alexander Luria, this book explores methods of preventing or overcoming learning disabilities. Tatiana V. Akhutina and Natalia M. Pylaeva build on Vygotsky and Luria's sociocultural theory and their principle of a systemic structure and dynamic organization of higher mental functions. They focus on the interactive scaffolding of the weak components of the child's functional systems, the transition from joint child-adult co-actions, and the emotional involvement of the child. The authors discuss effective ways to remediate issues with attention, executive functions (working memory and cognitive control) and spatial and visual-verbal functions. Overcoming Learning Disabilities translates complex problems into easily understandable concepts useful to school psychologists, special and general education teachers, and parents of children with learning disabilities.",

Mit Uber 400 Teilnehmern und 125 Vortr~gen war sie eine der groBten Taqungen der Gesellschaft. Zahlreiche ausl~ndische Gastreferenten bereicherten durch Fach\u00ad und Ubersichtsvortr!ge das weitgespannte Tagungsprogramm. In Berlin wurde mit Erfolg ein neuer Tagungsstil verwirklicht, der i.w. darin bestand, daB frUhzeitig die derzeit wichtigsten Gebiete des Operations Research zu Sektionen zusammengefaBt wurden. Die wissenschaftliche Betreuung dieser Sektionen geschah durch Sektionsleiter, denen es insbesondere zu verdanken 1st, daB den Fachbeitr~gen vieler Sektionen ein einfUhrendes Ubersichtsreferat vorangestellt werden konnte. Eine weitere Besonderheit der Tagung bestand in einer Verl!ngerung der Rede- und Diskussionszeit, was zusammen mit der graBen Anzahl von Vortr~gen dazu fUhrte, daB ver\u00ad gleichsweise viele Parallelsitzungen stattfanden. Die Proceedings sollen nun einen Uberblick Uber das wissenschaft\u00ad liche Tagungsprogramm geben. Dabei wurde besonderer Wert darauf gelegt, wenigstens den Ubersichtsvortr~gen breiten Raum zu gew!hren. Die Fachbeitr~ge muBten h~ufig gedr!ngter dargestellt werden, jedoch wurde darauf geachtet, daB - abgesehen von wenigen Ausnahmen - dem interessierten Leser eine ausfUhrliche Fassung zug~nglich 1st. Besondere Anerkennung gebuhrt der ortlichen Tagungsorganisation unter Leitung von Prof. Dr. P. Stahlknecht, der es ganz wesentlich zu verdanken 1st, daB in der angenehmen und anregenden Tagungs\u00ad atmosphare eine FUlle wissenschaftlicher Kontakte geknUpft werden konnte. Unser Dank gilt auch den Referenten und nicht zuletzt den Sektions\u00ad und Sitzungleitern, die einen wesentlichen Anteil an der Gestaltung dieses Tagungsbandes haben.",

        "summary": "David Kellogg Lewis (1941-2001) was one of the most influential philosophers of the twentieth century. He made significant contributions to almost every area of analytic philosophy including metaphysics, philosophy of language, philosophy of mind, and philosophy of science, and set the agenda for various debates in these areas which carry on to this day. In several respects he remains a contemporary figure, yet enough time has now passed for historians of philosophy to begin to study his place in twentieth century thought. His philosophy was constructed and refined not just through his published writing, but also crucially through his life-long correspondence with fellow philosophers, including leading figures such as D.M. Armstrong, Saul Kripke, W.V. Quine, J.J.C. Smart, and Peter van Inwagen. His letters formed the undercurrent of his published work and became the medium through which he proposed many of his well-known theories and discussed a range of philosophical topics in depth. A selection of his vast correspondence over a 40-year period is presented here across two volumes. As metaphysics is arguably where Lewis made his greatest contribution, this forms the focus of Volume 1. Arranged under the broad areas of Causation, Modality, and Ontology, the letters offer an organic story of the origins, development, breadth, and depth of his metaphysics in its historical context, as well as a glimpse into the influence of his many interlocutors. This volume will be an indispensable resource for contemporary metaphysics and for those interested in the Lewisian perspective.",

Now in its third edition and fully revised to reflect recent developments in the region, Politics Latin America provides students and teachers with an accessible overview of the region\u2019s unique political and economic landscape, covering every aspect of governance in its 21 countries. The book examines the international relations of Latin American states as they seek to carve out a role in an increasingly globalised world and will be an ideal introduction for undergraduate courses in Latin American politics, comparative politics, and other disciplines. This new edition will include: updated references to scholarship and debates; new themes such as environmental rights, women presidents, the Latin American Pope, Afro-Latinos, and the politics of sexual diversity; examination of demographic change and social movements; a new chapter on environmental economics and sustainable development. This book is essential reading for undergraduates taking courses in Latin American Politics.",

The authors discuss the similarities and differences between the crustal blocks of the shield and incorporate details concerning geochemistry, structural fabrics, and other special topics wherever necessary to achieve a full understanding of geologic relationships. Emphasis is placed on the broad features of the shield, with separate maps for each crustal block as well as tables of geochronological data included for further clarity.",

Storing up Treasures in Heaven takes up important wisdom themes such as the proper disposition of wealth, the importance of prioritizing one's thoughts and concerns, and the means to gaining eternal - not temporal - rewards. Parallels are found in literature as early and diverse as the Gospels of Mark, John, and Thomas, the Epistle of James, and Justin's Apology. The International Q Project's presentation of the critical text of Q 12:33-34, together with the exhaustive history of research on which it is based, will considerably enhance research in the Sayings Gospel Q, the historical Jesus, and the ethical concerns of early Jesus movements.",

This volume presents critical reviews of the biological aspects of C. burnetii. Topics covered include C. burnetii's place in the microbial world through a comparison with other microorganisms that are phylogenetically related or share phenotypic traits; intrinsic properties of Coxiella with respect to infectivity, virulence, and pathogenecity; past and current methods for the isolation, amplification, and purification of C. Burnetii; obligate acidophily; metabolic capabilities, with emphasis on intermediary metabolism, macromolecular synthesis, and protein export; and human immune responses to bacterial components during acute and chronic infection by C. Burnetii. Other fascinating topics about C. Burnetii include antigens, virulence factors, and biological response modifiers; ultrastructure; genetics; cloning and expression; and C. burnetii in the U.S.S.R. and China. Epidemiologists, molecular biologists, microbiologists, and other researchers interested in Q fever and C. burnetii should consider this book an essential reference resource.",

        "summary": "\"Variations in seismic Q are sensitive to a much greater extent than are seismic velocity variations on factors such as temperature, fluid content, and the movement of solid state defects in the earth. For that reason an understanding of Q and its variation with position in the earth and with time should provide information on earth's tectonic evolution, as well as on aspects of its internal structure. Papers of this volume present new information on Q in the earth from several perspectives: methodology, results from global and regional observations of both body and surface waves, laboratory measurements, and theoretical understanding. The editors believe that the present volume reaches a new threshold in Q studies and that advances in data quality and methodology will spur increased interest in this difficult, but interesting field.\"--BOOK JACKET.Title Summary field provided by Blackwell North America, Inc.

        "summary": "R Visualizations: Derive Meaning from Data focuses on one of the two major topics of data analytics: data visualization, a.k.a., computer graphics. In the book, major R systems for visualization are discussed, organized by topic and not by system. Anyone doing data analysis will be shown how to use R to generate any of the basic visualizations with the R visualization systems. Further, this book introduces the author\u2019s lessR system, which always can accomplish a visualization with less coding than the use of other systems, sometimes dramatically so, and also provides accompanying statistical analyses. Key Features Presents thorough coverage of the leading R visualization system, ggplot2. Gives specific guidance on using base R graphics to attain visualizations of the same quality as those provided by ggplot2. Shows how to create a wide range of data visualizations: distributions of categorical and continuous variables, many types of scatterplots including with a third variable, time series, and maps. Inclusion of the various approaches to R graphics organized by topic instead of by system. Presents the recent work on interactive visualization in R. David W. Gerbing received his PhD from Michigan State University in 1979 in quantitative analysis, and currently is a professor of quantitative analysis in the School of Business at Portland State University. He has published extensively in the social and behavioral sciences with a focus on quantitative methods. His lessR package has been in development since 2009.",

        "summary": "Volume 1 documents the methodology, developments, and findings of the two-year study. Among the significant results of this project are: (1) a new set of crossing signal visibility specifications based on widely accepted definitions of motorists' requirements and a demonstration that currently available signals exceed these specifications when properly maintained; (2) the evaluation of seven alterations to standard crossing signal design and operation with respect to performance improvement and maintenance requirements--several of these modifications offer attractive cost/benefit attributes and are recommended for implementation; and (3) the development and evaluation of three tools of potential value to signal maintenance crews: an alignment scope to aid in aiming of the signal for maximum effectiveness, a signal focusing tool to aid in the critical positioning of the signal lamp with respect to the reflector, and a signal flux meter for measuring the light output of crossing and traffic signals--all of these tools were proven effective and would be useful to a conscientious maintenance team. The prototype signal hardware underwent rigorous laboratory, environmental, and field tests. The maintenance tools were evaluated under laboratory conditions. Vol. III is intended to ba a stand-alone handbook for potential users of the project's developments.",

        "summary": "Treating older children and adolescents who have difficulty correctly producing /r/ sounds remains an ongoing source of frustration for many clinicians. The new professional resource Remediation of /r/ for Speech-Language Pathologists provides the most up-to-date information on the current understanding of /r/ and the related errors, along with a range of treatment options, to offer a comprehensive tool for Speech-Language Pathologists (SLPs) treating this complex issue. In addition to a discussion of traditional articulation therapy and ways to improve the administration of this technique, this practical text offers a detailed review and explanation of several very promising alternative approaches. Written in what has been described as Dr. Flipsen's \"folksy\" style, this text is designed for the busy clinician. The first five chapters of Remediation of /r/ for Speech-Language Pathologists delve into the basic information needed to treat /r/. The next six chapters each tackle a specific treatment option. The treatment section begins with a re-examination of traditional articulation therapy and uses research evidence to help clinicians to fine-tune its application. It then progresses to discussing more significant modifications to traditional therapy and introduces several newer approaches to modifying the feedback being provided to the client. For each treatment option, the author presents a solid rationale and the latest evidence, along with practical strategies for their implementation. The final chapter discusses methods for deciding which remediation method to choose when working with /r/ errors.",

The following matters are studied: the general and specific factors that have fuelled restructuring in Canadian firms; the general pattern of restructuring practices and the forms of restructuring; reasons for successful restructuring in some companies, and whether Canadian firms can learn from such experience; and the effects of restructuring on company profitability, productivity, and employment. Basic data for the study were compiled from an interview survey of individual companies. Types of restructuring examined include downsizing, total quality management, re- engineering, and outsourcing. The concluding section discusses whether corporate restructuring is successful and why, and shows what role government programs have played in corporate restructuring in Canada.",

        "summary": "This book identifies the distinguishing features of fundamental theology, as distinct from philosophical theology, natural theology, apologetics, and other similar disciplines. Addressing the potential for confusion about basic Christian claims and beliefs, Gerald O'Collins sets out to relaunch fundamental theology as a discipline by presenting a coherent vision of basic theological questions and positions that lay the ground for work in specific areas of systematic theology. Rethinking Fundamental Theology examines central theological questions: about God, human experience and, specifically, religious experience; the divine revelation coming through the history of Israel and through the life, death and resurrection of Jesus; human faith that responds to revelation; the nature of tradition that transmits the record and reality of revelation; the structure of biblical inspiration and truth, as well as basic issues concerned with the formation of the canon; the founding of the Church with some leadership structures; the relationship between Christ's revelation and the faith of those who follow other religions. O'Collins concludes with some reflections on theological method. Written with the scholarship and accessibility for which O'Collins is known and valued, this book will relaunch fundamental theology as a distinct and necessary discipline in faculties and departments of theology and religious studies around the world.",

He shows how some water markets have worked -- and others have failed -- and gives the reader the analytic tools necessary to understand why. Rivers of Gold is the first book to provide a detailed examination of water markets and the institutional design issues associated with them. Copyright \u00a9 Libri GmbH. All rights reserved.",

CCH's popular S Corporation Taxation offers an in-depth and comprehensive analysis to S corporation taxation and uses extensive examples to illustrate both simple and complex situations. In areas where authorities do not provide clear guidance, the author constructs plausible courses of action, with appropriate analysis.Published annually, S Corporation Taxation focuses on the rules of Subchapter S of the Internal Revenue Code and integrates these rules with other portions of the tax law that can have substantial impact on S corporations and their shareholders. At the end of each chapter are pertinent checklists, worksheets and sample election letters to help apply the concepts discussed to the reader's actual work.",

Many Shirshov\u2019s students and students of his students had a successful research career in mathematics. AnatoliiShirshovwasbornonthe8thofAugustof1921inthevillageKolyvan near Novosibirsk. Before the II World War he started to study mathematics at Tomsk university but then went to the front to ?ght as a volunteer. In 1946 he continued his study at Voroshilovgrad (now Lugansk) Pedagogical Institute and at the same time taught mathematics at a secondary school. In 1950 Shirshov was accepted as a graduate student at the Moscow State University under the supervision of A. G. Kurosh. In 1953 he has successfully defended his Candidate of Science thesis (analog of a Ph. D. ) \u201cSome problems in the theory of nonassociative rings and algebras\u201d and joined the Department of Higher Algebra at the Moscow State University. In 1958 Shirshov was awarded the Doctor of Science degree for the thesis \u201cOn some classes of rings that are nearly associative\u201d. In 1960 Shirshov moved to Novosibirsk (at the invitations of S. L. Sobolev and A. I. Malcev) to become one of the founders of the new mathematical institute of the Academy of Sciences (now Sobolev Institute of Mathematics) and to help the formation of the new Novosibirsk State University. From 1960 to 1973 he was a deputy director of the Institute and till his last days he led the research in the theory of algebras at the Institute.",

        "summary": "Semi-active Suspension Control provides an overview of vehicle ride control employing smart semi-active damping systems. These systems are able to tune the amount of damping in response to measured vehicle-ride and handling indicators. Two physically different dampers (magnetorheological and controlled-friction) are analysed from the perspectives of mechatronics and control. Ride comfort, road holding, road damage and human-body modelling are studied. Mathematical modelling is balanced by a large and detailed section on experimental implementation, where a variety of automotive applications are described offering a well-rounded view. The implementation of control algorithms with regard to real-life engineering constraints is emphasised. The applications described include semi-active suspensions for a saloon car, seat suspensions for vehicles not equipped with a primary suspension, and control of heavy-vehicle dynamic-tyre loads to reduce road damage and improve handling.",

        "summary": "We present an informational theory of public protests, according to which public protests allow citizens to aggregate privately dispersed information and signal it to the policy maker. The model predicts that information sharing of signals within social groups can facilitate information aggregation when the social groups are sufficiently large even when it is not predicted with individual signals. We use experiments in the laboratory and on Amazon Mechanical Turk to test these predictions. We find that information sharing in social groups significantly affects citizens' protest decisions and as a consequence mitigates the effects of high conflict, leading to greater efficiency in policy makers' choices. Our experiments highlight that social media can play an important role in protests beyond simply a way in which citizens can coordinate their actions; and indeed that the information aggregation and the coordination motives behind public protests are intimately connected and cannot be conceptually separated.",

Our understanding in these areas has been considerably advanced and enriched by the discovery of new techniques and the sharpening of old techniques, ranging all the way from computer simulations to mode-mode coupling theories. Statistical mechanics brings together under one roof a broad spectrum of mathematical methods. The aim of these volumes is to provide a didactic treatment of those topics that are most useful for the study of problems of current interest to theoretical chemists. The emphasis throughout is on the techniques themselves and not on reviewing the enormous literature in statistical mechanics. Each author was charged with the following task. Given N pages, (a) pose the problem, (b) present those aspects of the particular technique that cJearly illustrate its internal workings, (c) apply the technique to the solUlion of several illustrative examples, and (d) write the chapter so that it will enable the reader to approach key citations to the literature intelligently. These volumes are designed for graduate students and research workers in statistical mechanics. Nevertheless, they should be useful in other areas as weIl.",

(He was one of the best students that year, by the way. ) Because of his background, Fred has taken, in the Guide, the point of view of an experienced student tutor helping you to learn calculus. \\~ile we do not always think Fred's jokes are as funny as he does, we appreciate his enthusiasm and his desire to enter into communication with his readers; since we nearly always agree with the mathe matical judgements he has made in explaining the material, we believe that this Guide can serve you as a valuable supplement to our text. To get maximum benefit from this Guide, you should begin by spending a few moments to acquaint yourself with its structure. Once you get started in the course, take advantage of the many opportunities which the text and Student Guide together provide for learning calculus in the only way that any mathe matical subject can truly be mastered - through attempting to solve problems on your own. As you read the text, try doing each example and exercise your self before reading the solution; do the same with the quiz problems provided by Fred.",

        "summary": "We find that the APC can processively ubiquitinate target substrates, transferring multiple ubiquitin molecules to the substrate during a single binding event. The efficiency of this reaction depends upon the APC subunit Doc1; APC that are lacking only Doc1 display significant defects in the processivity of substrate ubiquitination. Biochemical analysis indicates that Doc1 stimulates processivity by enhancing the affinity of the substrate-APC interaction. Importantly, the interaction of Cdh1 with the APC is not affected by Doc1, suggesting that Doc1 contributes to the binding of substrates to core APC subunits.",

His kids were often at odds with each other, and he and his wife seemed to be continuously just trying to hold everything together. Good days were few and far between. He didn't expect death to come when it did. He wasn\u2019t prepared for it, but it came anyway. He soon found himself in a world out of his control, a world he had never imagined during his earthly life. A journey of discovery about himself and his Creator follows as he learns what happens after death. He is guided through the afterlife by his guardian angel, where he meets Jesus and witnesses a review of his life. He is shown scenes about his interactions with others, and he comes to better understand how his words and actions affected both them and him during his life. This aids him on his journey toward discovering who he really is. Ultimately he sees that everything God does has a beautiful purpose, even those things he couldn\u2019t understand when he was alive.",

        "summary": "The objective was to study the effects of map scale, map reference point variables, and training on the ability of pilots to estimate direction using Army tactical maps for low-level navigation. Twenty-four experienced officer and warrant officer pilot personnel working with various map reference point conditions made direction estimates using 48 maps with a scale of 1:100,000 and 48 maps with a scale of 1:250,000. The effect of training was studied by using a test-train-retest-delay-retest procedure. Performance was measured in terms of absolute error, in degrees, between the estimated direction and the correct direction. Analyses showed that average error in direction estimation using tactical maps was reduced significantly by training, dropping from a mean of 6.1 degrees before training to 4.8 degrees after training. There were also significant differences in accuracy of direction estimates as a function of map scale, distance between reference points, and compass octant in which the reference points were located.

        "summary": "No weapon platform sank more U-boats in the Second World War than the Allied aircraft. Whether it was an American \u2019plane operating from American escort carriers, US aircraft from Royal Air Force bases, or British aircraft from bases throughout the world, these officers and men became the most decisive factor in turning the tide of the Battle of the Atlantic against the German submarine threat. While the German crews could threaten escort vessels with torpedoes, or avoid them by remaining submerged, their leaders never developed an effective strategy against aircraft. However, the Allied aircraft did not enjoy much early success. British, Canadian and Australian air crews that fought the U-boats from 1939 until 1941 achieved few triumphs. They possessed neither the aircraft nor the bases necessary to deliver consistent lethal attacks against German submarines. In 1941, the Royal Air Force finally began implementing an effective aircraft response when it initiated training on the American-built Consolidated B-24 Liberators. Supported by other types then in service, these four-engine bombers would prove to be decisive. With America\u2019s entry into the war, the United States Navy and the United States Army Air Forces also began employing Liberators against the U-boats so that by mid-1943, the Admiral Karl D\u00f6nitz, commander of U-boat forces, withdrew his submarines from the North Atlantic in recognition of the Allied aircraft\u2019s new dominance. From D\u00f6nitz\u2019s retreat to the end of the war, Allied aircraft continued to dominate the U-boat battle as it shifted to other areas including the Bay of Biscay. D\u00f6nitz eventually ordered his U-boats to remain on the surface and engage Allied aircraft as opposed to submerging. This approach did lead to the demise of some Allied aircraft, but it also resulted in even more U-boat being sunk. Most critically, D\u00f6nitz acknowledged with his new policy that he knew of no tactics or weapons that would defend his submarines from Allied aircraft. In the end, it was a matter of choosing whether his submariners would die submerged or die surfaced. Either way, Allied aircraft prevailed. The Allied Air Campaign Against Hitler\u2019s U-Boats is the most comprehensive study ever undertaken of this most crucial battle which helped turn the Battle of the Atlantic irrevocably in favour of the Allies.",

        "summary": "The contents have been intriguingly divided into eight narrative threads that influenced and informed O'Connor's oeuvre. War includes the famous 'Guests of the Nation', set during the Irish War of Independence; Childhood draws on autobiographical writings to present a revealing picture of the author as a boy, the only child of an alcoholic father and doting mother; Writers bears witness to his literary debt to Yeats and Joyce. The stories in Lonely Voices movingly demonstrate O'Connor's theory that in this genre can be achieved 'something we do not often find in the novel - an intense awareness of human loneliness'; yet they are counterparted by his wonderfully polyphonic tales of family, friendship and rivalry in Better Quarrelling. In Ireland come poems, stories and articles inspired by the native land he loved but never sentimentalized, while from Abroad the writer in exile discourses upon universally relevant themes of emigration, hardship, absence and return. Finally, Last Things contains O'Connor's thoughts on religion, the church, the soul and its destiny, but remains above all a celebration of humanity 'who for me represented all I should ever know of God'.",

Playfully nicknamed \"The Big Fellow,\" Collins began to take a key role in the uprisings, eventually becoming a revered revolutionary leader. Acclaimed writer Frank O'Connor, a man who himself fought in the Irish Civil War, traces Collin's life from the day he returned to Dublin to the day a young Irish soldier shot him dead on a country road. The Big Fellow achieves a narrative both probing and poetic as it chronicles the life of a man so charismatic that he made people \"aware of his presence even when he was not visible, through that uncomfortable magnetism of the very air, a tingling of the nerves.\"",

        "summary": "Epic romances, fearsome dragons and alien worlds lie between the pages of this volume. Containing more than 35 stories from the early masters of fantasy literature, the narratives here transport the reader to alternate worlds where magic abounds, cosmic terrors lie around the corner and intrepid heroes fight for justice. Drawing inspiration from Norse, Japanese and Chinese mythology as well as from traditional fairytales and modern fears, the authors collected here span the breadth of the genre. Including tales from William Morris, H. G. Wells, Robert E. Howard and H. P. Lovecraft amongst others, they demonstrate the plethora of imaginative literature that was written in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Many of these tales were foundational works, bringing ideas of the supernatural into the mainstream, and through their efforts creating entirely new genres. Before Tolkien, there were many writers embracing the realm of fantastic fiction. The man responsible for its origin was George MacDonald (1824-1905), a Calvinist minister and Celtic scholar, who wrote the first true fantasy novel. He was followed by a number of imaginative successors at the end of the 19th century, including H. G. Wells, Arthur Machen, and Ernest Bramah. After the end of World War I, the pulp magazines opened up the genre to a new generation of writers - particularly H. P. Lovecraft and Robert E. Howard - who provided exciting, magical and horrifying tales that fascinated a multitude of readers. By the outbreak of World War II, the outlines of the fantasy genre had been sketched out by these pioneers, and an entirely new type of fiction had been created. This collection includes stories by: Robert E. Howard H. P. Lovecraft G. G. Pendarves H. G. Wells William Morris Lafcadio Hearn Abraham Merritt Arthur Machen Ernest Bramah Robert W. Chambers George MacDonald",

        "summary": "Through its Decca 5000 series of the 1930s and 1940s, the American Decca recording company became the most influential record label in the burgeoning hillbilly music category, the forerunner of today's country and western music. This unique discography provides for the first time in print a systematic numerical listing and cross-referencing of all released recordings in the 5000 and 17000 Cajun series as well as records released under Decca's Champion 45000 and Montgomery Ward series, also devoted to hillbilly music. A total of 1514 discs are covered ranging from records released by such major hillbilly music stars as Jimmie Davis, the Sons of the Pioneers, and Ernest Tubb to those by less well-known solo artists and groups, including the Corn Cob Crushers and the Happy Hollow Hoodlums. Based on painstaking research in the original session books, ledgers, and label copy books as well as interviews with musicians and singers who participated in Decca recording sessions, this discography of one of the most remarkable record series of the 20th century makes a major contribution to the study of contemporary American music. The volume begins with an introduction which traces the early history of the Decca Record Company and its impact on hillbilly music of the 1930s and 1940s. Cary Ginell demonstrates that the Decca 5000 and other hillbilly series had a major role not only in documenting the history of hillbilly music but also in affecting its course by influencing future recording artists in the genre. Following a brief section which describes how to use the discography and the indexes, the discography itself is divided into four separate numerical listings: Decca 5000, Decca 17000, Decca/Champion 45000, and Montgomery Ward recordings. Each listing includes information about recording dates, master numbers, unissued titles, song titles and legends, songwriter credits, and release dates. Five indexes--artist, matrix and location, release dates, composer credits, and title--provide enhanced access to the main listings. Scholars and researchers of American country and folk music, both once included under the hillbilly banner--will find this discography an indispensable resource.",

The title contests the notions that science alone can provide us with the most objective truth about the world, and that artistic endeavour can produce nothing more valuable than entertainment. O\u2019Hear argues that art and the study of art are not indispensable aspects of human life, and that this is equally as important as the investigation of the natural world.",

        "summary": "You will not find this education at you brokers how to section. Most likely you will not find this information anywhere on this book section on any other book store. I have paid thousands of dollars on exclusive groups and paid forums to collect the information presented in this book. As you can imagine these are the highly guarded secrets of the elite of the FOREX traders, no one gives their living away, unless you pay them a price worth their living. However I have decided to make this information for ridiculously low price, because I am fed up with the brokers and the big banks taking advantage of the regular retail trader. Let me ask you a question? When was the last time you make money with FOREX? Even further more how much money you are willing to lose, until you give up? How long you will continue to give your hard earned money to the broker? Just like you I started 5 years ago with high hopes of quitting my job and leaving the live I deserve with FOREX. My hopes and aspirations were quickly crashed and my dreams went to the dump. First I lost 1000, then 5000, 10k , how much longer I could continue like that, how much longer I could endure the ridicule the jokes of my family and the frown on the face of my wife. It was painful, sitting all day in front of the computer, until you can't see any longer and everything including the platform and your mind become blurry. I know the pain I have been there. This continued for year, until one morning I was ready to quit, I was going to give it a last try and throw that FOREX staff in the garbage, out the window. I stumbled on a rear tread, which since then has been banned, by the broker that was holding the forum. Luckily the tread continued under the broker's radar for while, and gathered a bunch of comments an support. Finally the tread from the trader X was discontinued. I was in dis pare, that was the only hope and light, I have seen for a long time. I was applying the advice from the trade and things were starting to work for me. Fortunately I was able to PM the trader and begged him to agree on a 20 min conversation on the phone. Trader X was not a guru, not your regular internet promoter mojo. He was quietly raking in thousands of dollars a month for years, he was not excited about the next trade, his heart beat was not raising before he pooled the trigger. See, he has been doing this trading staff for so long it has become a boring procedure, rather a morning an afternoon chore, something like putting the garbage out on garbage day. He explained that he learned from the MASTER, I did not proceed to ask him who was the MASTER, since I mainly was concerned with him teaching him every little bit of what he knew about trading. He didn't not agree to spend time teaching me on our first conversation, regardless of how much I offered to pay him. See, for him money was not a issue. Finally on my third approach he agreed to show me what the MASTER had thought him many years ago. What is comprised in the pages of this book will be worth pure gold to you.This book is down to the ground no no sense, real trading knowledge. It gives step by step instructions with real trade examples. This book is not your regular hog wash advice that you will find from your broker and the other magic bullets and seven step series that you see on this site. This book teaches you how to trade like the pros. Shows you how the big banks and foreign nationals and institution trade. The book opens your eyes to how to piggy back on the big institutional traders and win. Ninety Five percent of the people that trade the Forex market lose money and give up. The market is continually replaced by fresh blood like yourself. Don't become part of the statistics, read this book and get a map to success in FOREX. You can make a success in FOREX if you know what you are doing. Yes you can make a living with FOREX and quit your job. You can achieve your dreams. Buy this book and find out How?",

According to Laski, the state is not a supreme entity; it is one association among many that must compete for the people's loyalty and obedience.",

However, the emphasis will be on an interesting and entertaining read for the popular market, rather than an academic textbook. The publication will also be a good guide for the collector.The G- Plan Revolution will be a colourful, hardback, packed with period advertisements. It will have instant appeal to anyone who remembers G-Plan in its heyday, or those who have an interest in collecting furniture from the sixties or a general nostalgia for the era. The publication will not only discuss G-Plan, but also many other furniture manufacturers of this period. Designed by Sean Murphy of Value and Service, the book is an artwork in itself with a retro feel.",

        "summary": "O. Henry is the pen name of American writer William Sydney Porter (1862-1910). Porter's 400 short stories are known for their wit, wordplay, characterization and the clever use of twist endings. He travelled to Austin in 1884, where he took a number of different jobs over the next several years, first as pharmacist then as a draftsman, bank teller and journalist. He also began writing as a sideline to employment. Porter's most prolific writing period started in 1902, when he moved to New York City to be near his publishers. He wrote 381 short stories while living there. He wrote a story a week for over a year for the New York World Sunday Magazine. His wit, characterization and plot twists were adored by his readers, but often panned by the critics. Yet, he went on to gain international recognition and is credited with defining the short story as a literary art form. His works include: Cabbages and Kings (1904), The Four Million (1906), Heart of the West (1907), The Trimmed Lamp and Other Stories of the Four Million (1907), The Voice of the City: Further Stories of the Four Million (1908), The Gentle Grafter (1908) and Roads of Destiny (1909).",

Now, under the leadership of Allan Robinson, the series is again being extended with five new volumes currently planned that emphasizing the interaction of physical, chemical and biological oceanography. \"Coastal Ocean Phenomena\" is the first of these new volumes, and it deals with the general principles governing ocean phenomena in regions of shallower water near land. Processes such as tidal effects, global sea level changes, biological productivity, and sediment transport are analyzed. Models and methods are emphasized, including remote sensing, models of coastal ocean circulation, and data acquisition. Volume 10 presents the general principles, and volume 11 is organized geographically to presents the results of 35 of regional studies: Eastern North America, the Caribbean, the North Sea and Baltic, the Mediterranean Sea, and so forth. Volume 10 is a readable and systematic introduction to coastal oceanography that is suitable for use with college courses, while volume 11 is a much larger reference work. Note that volumes 10 and 11 are available together as a set (ISBN 0471-11543-6, tent $175.00.).",

        "summary": "Messianism is one of the great themes in intellectual history. But because it has done so much important ideological work for the people who have written about it, the historical roots of the discourse have been obscured from view. What did it mean to talk about \"messiahs\" in the ancient world, before the idea of messianism became a philosophical juggernaut, dictating the terms for all subsequent discussion of the topic? In this book, Matthew V. Novenson offers a revisionist account of messianism in antiquity. He shows that, for the ancient Jews and Christians who used the term, a messiah was not an article of faith but a manner of speaking. It was a scriptural figure of speech, one among numerous others, useful for thinking about kinds of political order: present or future, real or ideal, monarchic or theocratic, dynastic or charismatic, and other variations besides. The early Christians famously seized upon the title \"messiah\" (in Greek, \"Christ\") for their founding hero and molded the sense of the term in certain ways; but, Novenson shows, this is just what all ancient messiah texts do, each in its own way. If we hope to understand the ancient texts about messiahs (from Deutero-Isaiah to the Parables of Enoch, from the Qumran Community Rule to the Gospel of John, from the Pseudo-Clementines to Sefer Zerubbabel), we must learn to think not in terms of a world-historical idea but of a language game, of so many creative reuses of an archaic Israelite idiom. In The Grammar of Messianism, Novenson demonstrates the possibility and the benefit of thinking of messianism in this way.",

He takes into account the special conditions that control interpretation of epigraphical texts. He includes matters of topography, numismatics, and vase-painting. He asks questions a reader might never have thought to ask, e.g., Where is booty from a battle sold?

        "summary": "A fascinating history of the political theory of hegemony Few terms are so widely used in the literature of international relations and political science, with so little agreement about their exact meaning, as hegemony. In the first full historical study of its fortunes as a concept, Perry Anderson traces its emergence in Ancient Greece and its rediscovery during the upheavals of 1848\u20131849 in Germany. He then follows its checkered career in revolutionary Russia, fascist Italy, Cold War America, Gaullist France, Thatcher\u2019s Britain, post-colonial India, feudal Japan, Maoist China, eventually arriving at the world of Merkel and May, Bush and Obama. The result is a surprising and fascinating expedition into global intellectual history, ending with reflections on the contemporary political landscape.",

With a focus on the experience of multilingual professionals, the author's position is that such professionals, exemplified by those who have relocated internationally, deploy their unique linguistic, cultural and intercultural repertoires in their work. This book examines the ways in which professionals interpret and manage their experience of working within and across languages and cultures in ways that create affordances for them, their professional practice, and those who depend on their knowledge and expertise. It will be relevant to undergraduate and postgraduate students undertaking studies in applied linguistics, sociolinguistics, intercultural education and professional communication in any discipline.",

        "summary": "Learn the essential skills of psychological first aid from the expert who created the Johns Hopkins RAPID PFA method. Psychological first aid, or PFA, is designed to mitigate the effects of acute stress and trauma and assist those in crisis to cope effectively with adversity. PFA is designed to be applied in emergencies, including disasters and terrorist attacks. In this essential guide, George S. Everly, Jr., developer of the Johns Hopkins RAPID PFA method, and Jeffrey M. Lating, his collaborator in its implementation, describe the principles and practices underpinning this psychological model in an easy-to-follow, prescriptive, and practical manner. They explain the history of PFA and persuasively demonstrate its powerful versatility. Mental health practitioners can apply PFA in all settings. It can also be used as a public-health tool to address mental health needs following critical incidents and as a means for building community resilience. Aimed at mental health practitioners, all first responders, and global health disaster teams such as M\u00e9decins Sans Fronti\u00e8res and the World Health Organization, The Johns Hopkins Guide to Psychological First Aid is the first book to thoroughly explain RAPID PFA. RAPID, a unique theoretically grounded and evidence-based PFA method, follows a set of easily understood principles. In each chapter, Everly and Lating provide a step-by-step approach and include a key point summary to emphasize essential elements. A unifying case exemplifies each phase of the RAPID PFA model in an ongoing dialogue that presents ideal PFA responses, examples of common mistakes, and various outcomes. In addition to their counseling experience in Kuwait after the Gulf War and in New York City after the September 11 attacks, the authors have traveled nationally and internationally to teach the RAPID PFA method in numerous public health, fire, police, military, and faith-based settings. Beneficial to those with little or no previous mental health training, this book is an essential tool for people who want to learn, to practice, or to retain their ability to use psychological first aid effectively.",

He married Johanna Schurhammer in 1843, probably in the parish church at Blumenfeld. They had fourteen children, 1844-1865. Josef's half brother immigrated to the United States in 1854, and the members of the Josef Keller family followed, 1867-1881. Josef immigrated in 1876, after his wife's death. The family settled first in the area of New Berlin, Sangamon County, Illinois. Some later moved to Cincinnati, Ohio; South Bend, Indiana; and elsewhere. Josef Keller died at New Berlin at the home of his daughter, Kreszentia. Descendants lived in Illinois, Ohio, Indiana, Wisconsin, and elsewhere.",

This biography highlights Sobral's personal thoughts on the mission, his position, the science being discovered, and the geopolitical situation around him. The reader also learns about the state of science, Antarctic exploration, and cultural-political-issues at that time. The author's critical and contextual analysis of the diary explains more about Sobral and his role in Argentina, Antarctica, science and history. This paints a detailed picture of Sobral as an individual, and provides the framework to depict the world in which Sobral lived and worked as well as his expedition and accomplishments. The book aims to explain the context of Sobral's writings, the significance of the events he described in his diary entries, and the way all of these events tied into history and scientific discovery.",

In its legendary landmarks -- Mount Vernon, Monticello, the Virginia Capitol building in Richmond, the James River plantation mansions, the Reynolds Metals headquarters building in Richmond, Washington National Airport, and Dulles International Airport -- as well as in homes, churches, stores, and office buildings across the state, Virginia's architecture is a mirror of the many expressions of America's built environments. This book invites the readers on a journey through the eye and mind of the architect, from the very drawings that give shape and form to the idea, through the tracks and traces found in long lost letters, office records, and other primary sources. You will never see the buildings around you, anywhere, in the same way again. -- From publisher's description.",

Forty- one contributions are arranged in sections on the history of neutron star study--from early speculations to current problems, neutron star structure, radio pulsars, X-ray binaries, evolution of binaries, and X-rays from single neutron stars. Individual papers address subjects like pulsar magnetic fields and glitches, young neutron stars in supernova remnants, high- energy emission from binary pulsars, thermonuclear burning on rapidly accreting neutron stars, modelling gamma ray bursts, and the search for old neutron stars in molecular clouds.

Are you just tired of your past messing with your blessings? It may seem like your life is as good as it will get, until you discover that there is a better way. Many people still live in a past experience that hinders them from living in an abundant future. Abundant living comes in different ways depending upon what we feel true abundance means. Material abundance is nice to have, but spiritual abundance is what we must have. One of today's buzz-phrases is 'if it ain't broke, break it.' There are mind-sets that haven't yet been broken that need to be broken. One in particular, God is punishing me and that's why I'm getting what I'm getting. This type of mentality is not scriptural and I'm going to deal with it in this book. Your past may be uncomfortable, but it's not unforgivable. The scriptures doesn't tell us in all your getting, get things, but it does tell us, in all your getting, get an understanding. In knowing this, God created us to be abundant in Him, but we deviated from being complete in Him. Therefore; we must seek to understand and we will discover, How to get pass our past.",

Located at the intersection of Asia, Africa, and Europe, the Mediterranean has connected societies for millennia, creating a shared space of intense economic, cultural, and political interaction. Greek temples in Sicily, Roman ruins in North Africa, and Ottoman fortifications in Greece serve as reminders that the Mediterranean has no fixed national boundaries or stable ethnic and religious identities. In The Mediterranean World, Monique O\u2019Connell and Eric R Dursteler examine the history of this contested region from the medieval to the early modern era, beginning with the fall of Rome around 500 CE and closing with Napoleon\u2019s attempted conquest of Egypt in 1798. Arguing convincingly that the Mediterranean should be studied as a singular unit, the authors explore the centuries when no lone power dominated the Mediterranean Sea and invaders brought their own unique languages and cultures to the region. Structured around four interlocking themes\u2014mobility, state development, commerce, and frontiers\u2014this beautifully illustrated book brings new dimensions to the concepts of Mediterranean nationality and identity.",

        "summary": "Friedrich List is the father of economic nationalism and the historical school of economics. Responding to Adam Smith's free market apologetics, in The National System of Political Economy List provides a theoretical basis for state intervention in the economy. But he does much more than this-as part of a wider trend in European thought, List affirms the primacy of history in developing our worldview. The National System of Political Economy does not begin with theory, but with history. In so doing, List shows that England's rise as a commercial power was not facilitated by free markets but by protectionism, drawing his theory from historical fact rather than the other way around. List's avowed liberalism is overshadowed by his illiberal priors, and so the economic history of the 20th century was one of Listian principles being put to use by illiberal regimes such as Russia, China, and Germany. His thought also governed the economic policy of another developmental state for over a century-America. Smith and Marx formed the basis of 20th century economic theory. But Friedrich List stands as a colossus astride the 20th century, forming the basis of economic practice for all major powers until mid-century. In his introduction to this edition, Francis O'Beirne shows that the great economic clash has never been between capitalism and socialism, but between capitalism and nationalism, with Marxism a revolutionary force, but an economic irrelevancy.",

        "summary": "\"When I finished Unity Temple, I had it. I knew I had the beginning of a great thing, a great truth in architecture.\" -Frank Lloyd Wright Early on the morning of June 4, 1905, lightning struck the steeple of Unity Church in the Chicago suburb of Oak Park, igniting a fire that would raze the building to the ground. The Unitarian congregation suddenly needed a home and turned to local architect Frank Lloyd Wright for a new approach. Thus begins the story of a watershed moment in the career of the world's most influential architect and in the history of twentieth-century architecture and design. Wright's design for Unity Temple was radical in its simplicity-a monolithic concrete exterior-yet sublime in its detail and revolutionary in its use of interior space. With Wright's execution of Unity Temple, the ideas he'd been working on and experimenting with for years were finally brought to fruition, and modern design was born. But it might never have happened if not for a devoted Unitarian congregation who embraced Wright's ideas and remained faithful to the architect and his vision through the trials and calamities of construction. Unity Temple, when completed in 1909, was-and still is-considered one of the landmarks of modern architecture. Author David M. Sokol poured more than 20 years of research into The Noble Room and uncovers a dramatic tale-much of which turns out to be at odds with the accepted story of how Wright himself described the process. Anyone with an interest in architecture or in Frank Lloyd Wright-or indeed anyone who's ever had an addition put on to their house or a kitchen remodeled-will be caught up in the story of the tumultuous, chaotic creation of a modern masterpiece, which comes to life in The Noble Room.",

It provides an in-depth analysis of the country's export of oil and gas, showing how the energy sector went through the topsy-turvy period of Gorbachev's economic reform and the initial stages of market transition under Yeltsin. In doing so, it highlights the importance of the major oil and gas companies for the functioning of Russian politics.",

        "summary": "'With moral clarity and powerful storytelling, Cathy O'Neil reverse engineers the 'shame machine,' revealing its inner workings and inciting nothing short of a cultural reckoning that has the potential to blow this machine to bits' - Ruha Benjamin Shame is being weaponized by governments and corporations to attack the most vulnerable. It's time to fight back Shame is a powerful and sometimes useful tool. When we publicly shame corrupt politicians, abusive celebrities, or predatory corporations, we reinforce values of fairness and justice. But as best-selling author Cathy O'Neil argues in this revelatory book, shaming has taken a new and dangerous turn. It is increasingly being weaponized -- used as a way to shift responsibility for social problems from institutions to individuals. Shaming children for not being able to afford school lunches or adults for not being able to find work lets us off the hook as a society. After all, why pay higher taxes to fund programmes for people who are fundamentally unworthy? O'Neil explores the machinery behind all this shame, showing how governments, corporations and the healthcare system capitalize on it. There are damning stories of rehab clinics, reentry programs, drug and diet companies, and social media platforms -- all of which profit from 'punching down' on the vulnerable. Woven throughout The Shame Machine is the story of O'Neil's own struggle with body image and her recent weight-loss surgery, which awakened her to the systematic shaming of fat people seeking medical care. With clarity and nuance, O'Neil dissects the relationship between shame and power. Whom does the system serve? How do current incentive structures perpetuate the shaming cycle? And, most important, how can we all fight back?",

This study explores the theme of the unconscious in Proust's great novel, situating it against a backdrop of nineteenth-century models of the mind, and tracing its connections with major metaphoric and thematic networks in the novel. Dreams and spoken language in particular emerge as crucial sites of unconscious mental activity, providing a wealth of material on which one can base a comparative study of Proustian and Freudian models of the mind.",

Though it cost all you have, get understanding.\u201d \u2014Proverbs 4:7 (NIV) When a man\u2019s life embodies the pursuit of wisdom, it bears among its fruits the deep love and respect of his family, friends, and colleagues. Bruce K. Waltke is such a man. Wisdom has defined Dr. Waltke, both as one of his personal qualities and as the core of his many years of biblical study, invoking the highest efforts of his formidable intellect and etching itself indelibly on his character. In tribute to Dr. Waltke, we present this collection of writings exploring the wisdom perspective of the Bible. The Way of Wisdom displays a level of scholarship and insight in keeping with Bruce Waltke\u2019s high academic standards, and a breadth of outlook reflective of his own broad grasp of God\u2019s Word and its application to all of life.

        "summary": "Richard Allestree says, \u201cmeditation is a serious and solemn considering of heavenly things in the word of God, to the end that Christians may understand how much of God\u2019s word concerns them, and that their hearts may be raised to holy passion and resolution to do what it says every day they live here on earth.\u201d Godly meditation is part of the three legs to the stool of a Christian\u2019s spiritual devotions. Spiritual devotions, or the three spiritual disciplines comprise Bible reading, prayer and pondering the word of God, or what we call godly meditation. This meditation is the musing and mental study of heavenly truths. It is working the practical truths of the Bible into one\u2019s soul. In this, Christians are captivated with God\u2019s disclosure of heavenly truths to them in the bible. In the bible God displays himself to them. God is the infinite First-being, worthy of all love for Himself, and communicates that love to His people. They in turn love him back. Loving him back includes thinking about him. Though Christians live in the world, they have communion with the God of heaven through the word of God, throughout the whole course of their lives. They do this through godly meditation. Allestree not only shows what meditation is, and how it is to be done, but gives the reader twenty-eight meditations so that he can enter into a profitable time of daily meditation by practical example. This work is not a scan or facsimile, has been carefully transcribed by hand being made easy to read in modern English, and has an active table of contents for electronic versions.",

Aside from the great set-piece speeches that helped to define him as a world leader, he possessed a richly warm sense of humor and a ready wit honed both at home and on politics. This collection presents hundreds of examples of that very wit, from Kennedy's opinions on the campaign trail to his view of the Cuban Missile Crisis.

The rotations of the grains during deformation are neglected, and the average plastic strain in grains of a given orientation is calculated on the basis of the assumption that the grains under consideration are spherical and elastically isotropic.

        "summary": "THERE'S A WAR TO BE WON is the landmark story of one of the greatest armies in history, a conscript force of amateur soldiers who had an unparalleled record of combat success. Here -- for the first time in one volume -- is the chronicle of the United States Army's dramatic mobilization and stunning march to victory in World War II. In a lively and engrossing narrative that spans theaters of operations around the world, Geoffrey Perret tells how the Army was drafted, trained, organized, armed, and led at every stage of the war. Beginning with the prescient military planners of the 1930s, he offers vivid warts-and-all profiles of the farsighted commanders who would lead the way, men like Marshall, MacArthur, Eisenhower, Ridgway, Bradley, and Patton. Drawing heavily on important new source material in major archives throughout the United States, THERE'S A WAR TO BE WON offers new insights into the wartime Army, its commanders, and its battles. A major work of American military history. \"An immensely readable, well-researched history . . . Dramatic.\" -- Chicago Tribune",

        "summary": "This book provides an important study of the theology of Thomas F. Torrance, who is generally considered to have been one of the most significant theologians writing in English during the twentieth century, with a view toward showing how his theological method and all his major doctrinal views were shaped by his understanding of the doctrine of the Trinity. Torrance pursued a theology that was realist because he attempted to think in accordance with the unique nature of the object that is known. In holding to such a methodology, he drew an analogy between theology and natural science. This book demonstrates how, for Torrance, God relates with humanity within time and space so that creation finds its meaning in relation to God and not in itself; this enabled him to avoid many theological pitfalls such as agnosticism, subjectivism and dualism while explaining the positive implications of various Christian doctrines in a penetrating and compelling manner. This book offers an important resource for students of theology and for scholars who are interested in seeing how serious dogmatic theology shapes and should shape our understanding of the Christian life.",

One of the most praised things about Three Men in a Boat is how undated it appears to modern readers - the jokes have been praised as fresh and witt",

        "summary": "Sponsored by the Adolescent Mental Health Initiative of the Annenberg Public Policy Center (APPC) of the University of Pennsylvania and the Annenberg Foundation Trust at Sunnylands Trust, Treating and Preventing Adolescent Mental Health Disorders, Second Edition, provides a major update since the first edition in 2005. It addresses the current state of knowledge about the major mental health disorders that emerge during adolescence, including updated DSM-5 diagnostic criteria. Here, six commissions established by the APPC and the Sunnylands Trust pool their expertise on adolescent anxiety, schizophrenia, substance use disorders, depression and bipolar disorders, eating disorders, and suicidal behavior in sections that thoroughly define each disorder, outline and assess available treatments, discuss prevention strategies, and suggest a research agenda based on what we know and don't yet know about these various conditions. Two additional behavioral disorders-gambling and internet addiction--are covered in this second edition. As a meaningful counterpoint to its primary focus on mental illness, the volume also incorporates the latest research from a seventh commission--on positive youth development--which addresses how we can fully prepare young people to be happy and successful throughout their lives. Concluding chapters discuss overarching issues regarding the behavioral and mental health of adolescents: overcoming the stigma of mental illness, the research, policy, and practice context for the delivery of evidence-based treatments, and the development of a more robust agenda to advance adolescent health. Integrating the work of eminent scholars in both psychology and psychiatry, this work will be an essential volume for academics and practicing clinicians and will serve as a wake-up call to mental health professionals and policy makers alike about the state of our nation's response to the needs of adolescents with mental disorders.",

        "summary": "Spanning four decades and more than a thousand films, the creative output of Darryl D. Zanuck was astonishing and unparalleled. With The Jazz Singer he supervised the innovation of film sound. With The Public Enemy and Little Caesar he reinvented the gangster film. With 42nd Street he reinvigorated the musical. He set the standard for film biography with pictures such as Young Mr. Lincoln and The Story of Alexander Graham Bell . He innovated CinemaScope. And he molded the star images of James Cagney, Shirley Temple, Tyrone Power, Betty Grable, Marilyn Monroe, and Rin Tin Tin.In this major new biography, George F. Custen illuminates Zanuck's evolution into one of the most influential producers in American film. He explains what set him apart from rivals Irving Thalberg and David O. Selznick, how he developed the gritty realism that came to redefine motion pictures, and how he brilliantly predicted and capitalized on changing public tastes.Zanuck was a man of enormous energy and eccentricity, commanding his studio with a sawed-off polo mallet. Dozens of his memorable films\u2014including I Am a Fugitive from a Chain Gang , The Grapes of Wrath, Gentleman's Agreement, All About Eve, The Day the Earth Stood Still , and The Robe \u2014have come to represent the era in which they were made. Hard-boiled or nostalgic, historical or pure Hollywood, Zanuck's films and Zanuck himself have become legends of the cinema. But what exactly was this producer's contribution to the films he made? How did he rise from being a writer of silent serials to become head of production at Warner Brothers by his mid-twenties, and then to form his own studio, Twentieth Century-Fox at age thirty-three?Twentieth Century's Fox tells the whole story\u2014from Zanuck's boyhood to his tumultuous years with the feuding Warners, his battles with the censors and with his own actors, and the legendary acting-out of scenes during story conferences in his famous green office. Along the way, Custen treats us to inside stories about actors such as Edward G. Robinson, Gregory Peck, and Marilyn Monroe. In never-before-published story conference notes, telegrams, and surprisingly candid anecdotes, he reveals how\u2014more than any producer before or since\u2014this diminutive, enigmatic fellow from Wahoo, Nebraska, changed the way we look at film.Custen highlights the studio as the context of production. Zanuck's ability to shape the producer's role and the organizational style during the golden years of the studio system\u2014with its own peculiar methods, clearly delineated rules, and pecking order\u2014was the crucible out of which he forged a unique vision of American film and American culture.",

Here, Salmon examines these claims by first identifying the essence of neutrality and nonalignment and then applying that understanding to the Irish case. Arguing that Ireland has failed to meet the criteria normally associated with neutrality and nonalignment, he explores the controversial issue of whether neutrality is compatible with membership in the European Community, and compares the status of Ireland with those of Austria, Sweden, and Switzerland.",

Elementary school librarians today are working harder than ever, sometimes serving in two or more libraries. Most have very little time to develop lesson plans, particularly the task of relating them to standards. Elementary school librarians need materials aligned with Common Core standards that are ready to go. Written by working school librarians with 44 years of combined experience, this instructional book is designed for use with primary grade students and offers 37 library lessons that have been tested and refined in the authors' elementary school libraries. The lessons are constructed with follow-up materials and recommended book lists to encourage classroom teacher collaboration and continuation of the lesson. Each lesson is accompanied by reproducible patterns and worksheets and includes complete bibliographic information. Also included in each lesson are a description of the standards applied, skills and objectives addressed, recommended grade levels, lists of props and materials needed, a step-by-step lesson description, and follow-up activities. Provides lessons that are linked to national standards and appeal to teachers and librarians needing to have weekly plans that identify the specific standards taught Supplies accompanying patterns and reproducible handouts Suggests fun follow-up activities and book titles appropriate for further instruction",

With online and blended learning now the norm in K-12 education, educational therapists need new models of intervention, treatment, and relationship-building for their child-age clients. This book offers detailed single-case research focused on a middle school student who is learning virtually while challenged with ADHD as well as visual and verbal memory issues, but who is nonetheless found ineligible for special education services. Across eight chapters, author and renowned educational therapist Marion E. Marshall describes the neuropsychological principles, research-based techniques, personal interactions, clinical approaches, and advocacy efforts that led to a vulnerable student's significant gains in academic skills and outcomes\"--",

        "summary": "Intended as a reference for the academically-oriented geologist as well as the practising economic geologist, this book is concerned with the study of skarn deposits having anomalously high tin or tungsten contents, or both. Unlike many other books on economic geology, both economic W-Sn skarns and non-economic examples are covered, in order to enable the academically-oriented reader to grasp the full range of such deposits, and also to aid the economic geologist in distinguishing between W-Sn skarns having economic potential and those which do not. W-Sn skarns are notoriously complex, containing a wide range of textures, grain sizes, mineral assemblages, bulk compositions and structures. The lack of a sufficiently detailed data base, coupled with some unsupportable genetic models, has led to many misunderstandings and has often resulted in needless expenditure and effort on fruitless mineral exploration. Thus, the first aim of this book is simply to provide an adequate data base with sufficient references to enable an interested worker to define a skarn deposit and know where to find additional information on similar examples.",

        "summary": "WTF? can be an expression of amazement or an expression of dismay. In today\u2019s economy, we have far too much dismay along with our amazement, and technology bears some of the blame. In this combination of memoir, business strategy guide, and call to action, Tim O'Reilly, Silicon Valley\u2019s leading intellectual and the founder of O\u2019Reilly Media, explores the upside and the potential downsides of today's WTF? technologies. What is the future when an increasing number of jobs can be performed by intelligent machines instead of people, or done only by people in partnership with those machines? What happens to our consumer based societies\u2014to workers and to the companies that depend on their purchasing power? Is income inequality and unemployment an inevitable consequence of technological advancement, or are there paths to a better future? What will happen to business when technology-enabled networks and marketplaces are better at deploying talent than traditional companies? How should companies organize themselves to take advantage of these new tools? What\u2019s the future of education when on-demand learning outperforms traditional institutions? How can individuals continue to adapt and retrain? Will the fundamental social safety nets of the developed world survive the transition, and if not, what will replace them? O'Reilly is \"the man who can really can make a whole industry happen,\" according to Eric Schmidt, Executive Chairman of Alphabet (Google.) His genius over the past four decades has been to identify and to help shape our response to emerging technologies with world shaking potential\u2014the World Wide Web, Open Source Software, Web 2.0, Open Government data, the Maker Movement, Big Data, and now AI. O\u2019Reilly shares the techniques he's used at O\u2019Reilly Media to make sense of and predict past innovation waves and applies those same techniques to provide a framework for thinking about how today\u2019s world-spanning platforms and networks, on-demand services, and artificial intelligence are changing the nature of business, education, government, financial markets, and the economy as a whole. He provides tools for understanding how all the parts of modern digital businesses work together to create marketplace advantage and customer value, and why ultimately, they cannot succeed unless their ecosystem succeeds along with them. The core of the book's call to action is an exhortation to businesses to DO MORE with technology rather than just using it to cut costs and enrich their shareholders. Robots are going to take our jobs, they say. O'Reilly replies, \u201cOnly if that\u2019s what we ask them to do! Technology is the solution to human problems, and we won\u2019t run out of work till we run out of problems.\" Entrepreneurs need to set their sights on how they can use big data, sensors, and AI to create amazing human experiences and the economy of the future, making us all richer in the same way the tools of the first industrial revolution did. Yes, technology can eliminate labor and make things cheaper, but at its best, we use it to do things that were previously unimaginable! What is our poverty of imagination? What are the entrepreneurial leaps that will allow us to use the technology of today to build a better future, not just a more efficient one? Whether technology brings the WTF? of wonder or the WTF? of dismay isn't inevitable. It's up to us!",

        "summary": "It has been said that M*A*S*H was a show set in the 1950s which reflected the shifting values of the 1970s and early 1980s. Hawkeye Pierce, Radar O'Reilly, Trapper John McIntyre, Sherman Potter, Margaret (Hot Lips) Houlihan, B.J. Hunnicutt, Frank Burns, Charles Emerson Winchester, Max Klinger--these and the many other characters who populated the MASH 4077 used the Korean War as a backdrop to comment on many of the social issues of their day. Using a unique blend of comedy and drama, the show's first three seasons (1972-1975) focused on the anti-Vietnam War sentiment that consumed much of America. As Vietnam ended, M*A*S*H moved on to concentrate on other contemporary issues--the women's movement, the rise of the religious right in American politics, the new narcissism that marked the early 1980s, the heightened awareness of underage or excessive alcohol use, and the increased emphasis on family in American life. How the series presented these issues and its success in doing so are the subjects of this critical study. An episode listing--brief plot outline, casts and credits, air dates, and titles--is also provided.",

        "summary": "WHAT AM I DOING HERE? by Dr. LeRoy Maleck O.D. is Book III and potentially the most moving of his life experiences. This book contains the recollections of that time in life when a 22 year old army combat infantry medic was forced to rapidly mature and change forever. The author's first person style and account clearly comes from being there. This book chronicles his entry into the army as seen by a new recruit. The true account continues through basic training, continued training and the introduction to army life and situations that seem as a satire and have humorous moments. Follow his journey with the 137th Infantry Regiment, aboard a troop ship to England. Then in early July, D Day + 28 Days, his Regiment is on Omaha Beach. Roughly 11 days later he, with his unit is engaged in something his training could not prepare him for, combat with a determined, entrenched enemy. Follow the exploits of war through the eyes of a combat infantry medic who went through, survived, and helped others survive. of some of the most brutal battles faced by the U.S. Army in World War II, Including the Northern France Campaign and the Battle of the Bulge. In addition to an army combat medic's first person account of his participation in World War II, the author has included a sorry about a rather amazing four legged friend, Speed. Speed was his Uncle Bill's dog, companion, and often hunting partner. In contrast to the War chronicles you may find this amazing heartwarming and just a great sorry about a truly amazing dog.",

Goekoop mines Homer's original text to unearth a wealth of geographical clues and then offer his own theories.

        "summary": "\"Worldly Philosopher chronicles the times and writings of Albert O. Hirschman, one of the twentieth century's most original and provocative thinkers. In this gripping biography, Jeremy Adelman tells the story of a man shaped by modern horrors and hopes, a worldly intellectual who fought for and wrote in defense of the values of tolerance and change. Born in Berlin in 1915, Hirschman grew up amid the promise and turmoil of the Weimar era, but fled Germany when the Nazis seized power in 1933. Amid hardship and personal tragedy, he volunteered to fight against the fascists in Spain and helped many of Europe's leading artists and intellectuals escape to America after France fell to Hitler. His intellectual career led him to Paris, London, and Trieste, and to academic appointments at Columbia, Harvard, and the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton. He was an influential adviser to governments in the United States, Latin America, and Europe, as well as major foundations and the World Bank. Along the way, he wrote some of the most innovative and important books in economics, the social sciences, and the history of ideas. Throughout, he remained committed to his belief that reform is possible, even in the darkest of times. This is the first major account of Hirschman's remarkable life, and a tale of the twentieth century as seen through the story of an astute and passionate observer. Adelman's riveting narrative traces how Hirschman's personal experiences shaped his unique intellectual perspective, and how his enduring legacy is one of hope, open-mindedness, and practical idealism\"--",
