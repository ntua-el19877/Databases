Generally, the bulky Gasper-Rahman notation was used, but the published works on q-calculus looked different depending on where and by whom they were written. This confusion of tongues not only complicated the theoretical development but also contributed to q-calculus remaining a neglected mathematical field. This book overcomes these problems by introducing a new and interesting notation for q-calculus based on logarithms.For instance, q-hypergeometric functions are now visually clear and easy to trace back to their hypergeometric parents. With this new notation it is also easy to see the connection between q-hypergeometric functions and the q-gamma function, something that until now has been overlooked. The book covers many topics on q-calculus, including special functions, combinatorics, and q-difference equations. Apart from a thorough review of the historical development of q-calculus, this book also presents the domains of modern physics for which q-calculus is applicable, such as particle physics and supersymmetry, to name just a few.​') ;

Adding to the difficulty is that most modelers learn the steps involved in cleaning and managing data piecemeal, often on the fly, or they develop their own ad hoc methods. This book helps simplify their task by providing a unified, systematic approach to acquiring, modeling, manipulating, cleaning, and maintaining data in R. Starting with the very basics, data scientists Samuel E. Buttrey and Lyn R. Whitaker walk readers through the entire process.

In this diverse set of essays, Angharad N. Valdivia breaks theoretical and methodological boundaries by exploring the relationship of the media to various audiences. Throughout A Latina in the Land of Hollywood we are challenged to think differently about the media messages we often unconsciously consume, such as the popular representations of certain Latina cultural icons. Valdivia shows how reporters focus on Guatemalan activist Rigoberta Menchús big smile, Brazilian media magnate Xuxas blonde hair, and Puerto Rican actress Rosie Perezs high-pitched voice, never quite creating a comprehensive portrayal of these women. In her discussion of lingerie catalogs, Valdivia uncovers a similarly skewed depiction. The lush, high-class bedrooms of Victorias Secret differ as much from the earthy, spare world of Fredericks of Hollywood as the types, sizes, and uses of the lingerie that the two companies sell. Valdivia takes a look at family films, arguing that single mothers are almost always portrayed as either trampy floozies or sexless, hapless women, whereas single dads fare much better. Whether examining one teenagers likes and dislikes or considering single parenthood in family films, Valdivia investigates how popular culture has become the arena in which we struggle to know ourselves and to make ourselves known. She calls for scholars to move beyond investigating implicit themes in films and media to studying the ways that audiences of different colors, ages, genders, and sexual preferences might understand or misunderstand such cultural messages. A Latina in the Land of Hollywood aims to explode traditional discussions of media and popular culture. It is a must-read for anyone interested in popular culture, television, and film.') ;

In this book, Onora ONeill shows how digital technologies have made communication more demanding: they can support communication with huge numbers of distant and dispersed recipients; they can amplify or suppress selected content; and they can target or ignore selected audiences. Often this is done anonymously, making it harder for readers and listeners, viewers and browsers, to assess which claims are true or false, reliable or misleading, flaky or fake. So how can we empower users to assess and evaluate digital communication, so that they can tell which standards it meets and which it flouts? That is the challenge which this book explores.') ;

Insert into Summary (`BookID`,`Summary`) Values ('62','In a high-tempo series of operations throughout the Black Sea, Aegean Sea and eastern Mediterranean, a small American fleet of destroyers and other naval vessels responded ably to several major international crises including the last days of the Russian Revolution and the 1920-1922 Turkish Nationalist Revolution. Officers and men of the navys four-piper destroyers began by investigating circumstances on the ground in mainland Turkey right after World War I, and by transporting American relief teams to ports throughout Turkey and Southern Russia to aid the tens of thousands of orphans and refugees who had survived the wartime Armenian genocide. Then the destroyers assisted in the final evacuation of 150,000 White Russians from the Crimea to Constantinople (one of the final acts of the Russian Revolution); coordinated the visits of the Hoover grain ships to ports in Southern Russia where millions were enduring a horrendous famine; witnessed and reported on the terrible dolorosa of the Greeks of the Pontus regious of Turkey; and, in September of 1922, conducted the evacuation of hundreds of thousands of Greek and Armenian refugees from burning Smyrna. This latter event was the cataclysmic conclusion of the Turkish Nationalist Revolutino, which had begun in early 1920. After Smyrna, the destroyers escorted Greek steamers in their rescue of ethnic Christian civilians being expelled from all the ports of Anatolian Turkey. As the conclusion of a long war between Nationalist Turks and an invading Hellenic Greek army, these people were being forced out of their ancestral homes by the Turks. Sometimes American destroyers carried hundreds of such refugees to friendly ports on their own weather decks. Upon the burning of Smyrna of September of 1922, Admiral Mark Bristols small fleet had grown to some 26 naval vessels, most of them destroyers, although some cruisers, naval repair vessels and supply ships also came, and the battleships Arizona and Utah also appeared briefly. It was during 1922 that the destroyer BAinbridge rescued 482 of 495 men, women and children from the burning French transport Vinh Long in teh Sea of Marmora. The destroyer accomplished this by the expedient of ramming the large French ship so the exploding ammunition could not continue to force the vessels apart. For this action, Lieut.Commander W. Atlee Edwards was awarded the Medal of Honor by America, and the Legion of Honor by France. Over four years, Admiral Bristol maintained a strong grip on American naval and diplomatic affairs throughout the region. Headquartered at the American Embassy at Constantinople, Bristol also worked to further American business interests in Turkey, and tended to favor Turks over Greeks and Armenians in the process. Many Americans were convinced that Bristol was biased on behalf of the Turks, and a couple of navy captains risked their careers by speaking out about impending Turkish massacres that Bristol wanted to hush up.') ;

This new book does an outstanding job of filling in the knowledge and perspective that engineers must have to be good citizens in areas ranging from the environment, to intellectual property, to ensuring the health of the innovation ecosystem that has done so much for modern society. This is exactly the sort of book that engineers and those who work with them should read and discuss over pizza, coffee, or some other suitable, discussion-provoking consumable. John L. Hennessy, president, Stanford University Citizen Engineer is the bible for the new era of socially responsible engineering. Its an era where, as the authors show, engineers dont just need to know more, they need to be more. The work is an inspiration, an exhortation, and a practical how-to guide. All engineers concerned with the impact of their work and that should be all engineers must read this book. Hal Abelson, professor of computer science and engineering, MIT Code is law. Finally, a map to responsible law making. This accessible and brilliant book should be required of every citizen, and especially, the new citizen lawmakers we call engineers. Lawrence Lessig, director, Safra Center for Ethics, Harvard University, and cofounder, Creative Commons Being an engineer today means being far more than an engineer. You need to consider not only the design requirements of your projects but the full impact of your work from an ecological perspective, an intellectual property perspective, a business perspective, and a sociological perspective. And you must coordinate your efforts with many other engineers, sometimes hundreds of them. In short, weve entered an age that demands socially responsible engineering on a whole new scale: The era of the Citizen Engineer. This engaging and thought-provoking book, written by computer industry luminaries David Douglas and Greg Papadopoulos, focuses on two topics that are becoming vitally important in the day-to-day work of engineers: eco engineering and intellectual property (IP).

Insert into Summary (`BookID`,`Summary`) Values ('178','The psychologist who pursues an interest in personality is constantly faced by a dilemma. He seeks to investigate what is to him the most intriguing and interesting subject--the multifaceted operations of man in his natural environment. The predicament lies in the discrepancy between the complexity and richness of mans subjective experience, and the pallid analog of these experiences the psychologist is able to study effectively with the research procedures available to him. In Concepts of Personality Joseph M. Wepman and Ralph W. Heine offer a comprehensive survey of classical and contemporary personality theory, including a wide array of examples of these two trends. If the psychologist holds to the premises of strict objectivity through controlled observations, he finds himself driven to the periphery of the very problem he seeks to understand. This is a place where the reliability of measurement and the validity and predictability of his instruments can often be specified, but only at the cost of abandoning the goal of useful generality or of application to the individual in his ordinary life circumstances. Concepts of Personality, unlike most books on the subject, is not limited to broad, general theories. It includes chapters on basic processes--learning, perception, genetics, and drive theory; on the major analytical approaches of psychology and psychiatry; on anthropological and sociological contributions; and on the problems of measurement and assessment. Each chapter is by an authority on the point of view expressed.

In Concepts of Personality Joseph M. Wepman and Ralph W. Heine offer a comprehensive survey of classical and contemporary personality theory, including a wide array of examples of these two trends. If the psychologist holds to the premises of strict objectivity through controlled observations, he finds himself driven to the periphery of the very problem he seeks to understand. This is a place where the reliability of measurement and the validity and predictability of his instruments can often be specified, but only at the cost of abandoning the goal of useful generality or of application to the individual in his ordinary life circumstances. Concepts of Personality, unlike most books on the subject, is not limited to broad, general theories. It includes chapters on basic processes--learning, perception, genetics, and drive theory; on the major analytical approaches of psychology and psychiatry; on anthropological and sociological contributions; and on the problems of measurement and assessment. Each chapter is by an authority on the point of view expressed. The editors introduction, itself a major essay on the complex and divergent patterns and themes of contemporary views of personality, carefully leads the reader through the information at hand. The book as a whole constitutes an encyclopedic summary of the state of the science. Joseph M. Wepman was professor of psychology and surgery and chairman of the Interdepartmental Clinical and Counseling Psychology Training Program of the University of Chicago. He is the author of Recovering from Aphasia and Aphasia and the Family. Ralph W. Heine was professor of psychiatry and psychology and chief clinical psychologist in the department of psychiatry at the University of Chicago. He is the author of The Student Physician as Psychotherapist and Psychotherapy.') ;

Drawing on rich empirical data, the book provides an ethnographic account of a government and a low-fee private school in Hyderabad, India, and explores life in these two distinct spaces through the lens of culture. While private schools catering to the poorer sections have been proliferating, little is known about how these low-fee private schools operate, how choices and negotiations unfold, the classroom discourses, subjective meanings of different stakeholders, and the kind of education provided in these schools vis-à-vis the government schools. The book focuses on the educational experiences, schooling choices, processes, and voices of the children and teachers at these schools to reflect on how school culture influences the quality of education. Based on intensive fieldwork and qualitative data, the book provides contextual insights into what exactly happens inside the schools and classrooms of two contrasting schooling provisions in India and helps understand the world views of different stakeholders as they negotiate their daily lives. The book will be of interest to students, researchers, and teachers of education, sociology of education, childhood studies, urban education, and teacher education.

Jerome Delaney, a professor of educational administration and former high school principal, answers the big questions about education policy in this powerful and practical primer for students. Informed by his experience in the public school system, Delaney takes a pragmatic and realistic approach that divides a complicated subject into manageable sub-topics. He grounds the debate at the classroom level: after all, that’s where the effects of high-level policy decisions ultimately play out. Starting from the basics and progressing through to the deeper aspects of education policy, this text provides an excellent introduction to a subject that lies at the foundation of every education system. This second edition includes a new chapter on issues relating to policy implementation, as well as new discussion questions at the end of each chapter.

The canopy-flat-pattern sweep angles investigated on the 550 swept wing were 42.50, 450, 47.50, 500, and 52.50. Several other modifications to the canopy shape were also studied, such as removal of single, double, and compound gores from the rear part of each canopy lobe. A study of the effects of wing-leading-edge sweep angle was made between sweep angles of 500 and 600 and effects of leading-edge diameter were obtained at the basic 550 sweep angle. Effects of keel web height were determined for a constant trailing-edge length and also for trailing-edge lengths that varied with web height.') ;

The addition of nuclear weapons to the bombers armament made it even more formidable, and by the late 1940s, US planners saw the growth of a Soviet nuclear-armed bomber fleet as a terrifying threat to North American security. Conventional subsonic fighters with guns and free-flight air-to-air rockets would be incapable of reaching these incoming bombers in time to prevent even one from delivering a devastating nuclear attack. As a result, supersonic speed, long-range guided missiles and precise radar-based control of an interception became prerequisites for a new breed of fighters, beginning with the F-102. A massive research and development effort produced the F-102A 1954 Fighter, the J57 afterburning turbojet, its Hughes MX-1554 fire control system and, in due course, the Semi-Active Ground Environment (SAGE) radar and communications network that covered North America to guide its airborne defences. In service, F-102As also provided air defence in Europe with USAFE, in the Far East and in Southeast Asia, where they protected US airbases in South Vietnam and Thailand from air attack by North Vietnamese fighters and bombers and escorted B-52s and fighter-bombers on their attack sorties. This illustrated study from leading expert Peter E. Davis details the design, development, and deployment of the futuristic F-102, including its complex research program and role in Vietnam.') ;

It was an opportunity for Anglicans who regarded themselves as loyal to Rome, despite the interruption of the Reformation, to promote Catholic theology in the Church of England. A high doctrine of the Church and the sacraments, ritualistic worship and the revival of religious life - plus remarkable social work in slum areas - all characterise what we now call Anglo-Catholicism, still alive and well and accounting for a third of the C of E today. Here the writings of the leading lights of the Oxford Movement are introduced with a useful commentary and explanation.') ;

What if you can master the game Forex trading, and trade from any place in the world where internet is available? What if all your dreams of leaving the dreaded... J.O.B. become reality...being able to give your family and loved ones the lifestyle they deserve. See, Forex is not for everyone, but is it a legitimate way out of the 9 to 5 rat race. See, as I am writing this introduction for you I am sitting under the bimini of my 51 foot sail boat yacht, in the heart of the Caribbean. Water is crystal turquoise blue, you can see all the way to the bottom.. The colors are incredible. It gives you such of sense of freedom and ability to enjoy life to the fullest. Man paradise, no alarm clocks, no traffic, I can hear the music from the small marina bar. I am not even at the marina, the boat is anchored at a mooring ball. Ha... tell me about the life, that you can have...yeah you can have it too. You need to be sick enough of your same all, same all in order to take action. Do you want trade like the pros, then you have to learn from the pros. You will not find the information in this book anywhere on the Amazon traders section. In a matter of fact no one is teaching what I am about to show you in this book. You would ask, what is so special about it. See, the people that are making a living from Forex are not about to reveal their secrets. The ones that are making money from your trades A . K. A. your friendly broker dont care . In a matter of fact they will gladly offer their friendly education, to teach you how you can too loose a large amount of money like your fellow retail traders that are using the same broker. I am revealing the highly guarded secrets of the big guns. It is possible that I get some ugly letters from traders, and even some of my friends, after this book is released. But heck yeah, I am sick and tired of seeing the daily casualty of honest and hard working people, like yourself loose their hard earned money to the broker. Enough is enough, I have made my stake is time to give back and help others to go the same road. So enough of my blurb... I have laid my hard learned secrets in that book and the price is ridiculously low. You would normally pay 2-3 times more in your local book store, for a book full of BS explaining you, the current economic climate, and how we are coming out of the recession hog wash. Year it says learn how to trade or something of that effect, but doesnt have even one tenth of the hard core to the bone content I am offering you. See I know you can live and have anything you want in this life. You can even create your own reality. Yeah I know creating you reality is cool, but it requires a dirty word called work. Do you you want to create your new reality, even step in to it. You would if you knew what is on the other side. Well I decided to create you reality for you. I have done all the dirty work and have set everything up for you for success in this book. So, punch a few buttons and take a click of faith and by this book. I promise you, you will not be disappointed. See you on the other side.') ;

Insert into Summary (`BookID`,`Summary`) Values ('271','Designed to serve as a basic text for introductory courses in public administration, this pioneering work provides students with a clear-eyed understanding of the vital management functions covered in most standard textbooks with two important differences. First, it is written to address the needs of both the experienced practitioner and the entry-level public servant. Case examples bridge the content-rich environment of practitioners with the principles of public administration sought by pre-service students. Second, the discussion of management practices is grounded in the political and ethical tensions inherent in the American constitutional form of governance. This innovative approach reflects the authors belief that public administration operates as an integral part of the countrys political traditions, and thereby helps define the political culture. Key themes in this third edition include: - An emphasis on the ways in which public administration and their agents play a critical role in ensuring legal and political accountability of the political system. - An exploration of local public administration as the backstop of American democracy, requiring a close working partnership between part-time elected officials and career administrators. - Careful examination of the ways in which American political economy requires administrators who are skilled at co-producing the common good with voluntary associations, businesses, nonprofit organizations and other governmental entities. - An understanding that public administration plays a critical role with its prudential judgments in balancing the competing values necessary to secure a regime of ordered liberty. Every chapter has been thoroughly updated, with particular attention paid to chapters on budgeting and revenue, e-government and the digital divide, shared power and the rise of wicked problems,  and the future of public administration in the United States amidst deep polarization. Foundations of Public Service, 3rd Edition provides a framework for understanding American political traditions and how they inform public administration as a political practice. It is required reading for all introductory Public Administration courses with an emphasis on practice and real-world applications.') ;

The first part covers data input/output, calculation of commonly used indexes and plotting in R. The core of the book then focusses on the presentation and practical implementations of modelling techniques used for fingerprinting processes such as partial melting, fractional crystallization, binary mixing or AFC using major-, trace-element and radiogenic isotope data. The reader will be given a firm theoretical basis for forward/reverse modelling, followed by exercises dealing with typical problems likely to be encountered in real life, and their solutions using R. The concluding sections demonstrate, using practical examples, how a researcher can proceed in developing a realistic model simulating natural systems. The appendices outline the fundamentals of the R language and provide a quick introduction to the open-source R-package GCDkit for interpretation of whole-rock geochemical data from igneous and metamorphic rocks.') ;

Flannery O’Connor is a master of twentieth-century American fiction, joining, since her untimely death in 1964, the likes of Hawthorne, Hemingway, and Faulkner. Those familiar with her work know that her powerful ethical vision was rooted in a quiet, devout faith and informed all she wrote and did. Good Things Out of Nazareth, a much-anticipated collection of many of O’Connor’s previously unpublished letters—along with those of literary luminaries such as Walker Percy (The Moviegoer), Caroline Gordon (None Shall Look Back), Katherine Anne Porter (Ship of Fools), Robert Giroux and movie critic Stanley Kauffmann. The letters explore such themes as creativity, faith, suffering, and writing. Brought together, they form a riveting literary portrait of these friends, artists, and thinkers. Here we find their joys and loves, as well as their trials and tribulations as they struggle with doubt and illness while championing their beliefs and often confronting racism in American society during the civil rights era. Praise for Good Things Out of Nazareth “An epistolary group portrait that will appeal to readers interested in the Catholic underpinnings of OConnors life and work . . . These letters by the National Book Award–winning short story writer and her friends alternately fit and break the mold. Anyone looking for Southern literary gossip will find plenty of barbs. . . . But there’s also higher-toned talk on topics such as the symbolism in O’Connor’s work and the nature of free will.”—Kirkus Reviews “A fascinating set of Flannery O’Connor’s correspondence . . . The compilation is highlighted by gems from O’Connor’s writing mentor, Caroline Gordon. . . . While O’Connor’s milieu can seem intimidatingly insular, the volume allows readers to feel closer to the writer, by glimpsing O’Connor’s struggles with lupus, which sometimes leaves her bedridden or walking on crutches, and by hearing her famously strong Georgian accent in the colloquialisms she sprinkles throughout the letters. . . . This is an important addition to the knowledge of O’Connor, her world, and her writing.”—Publishers Weekly') ;

Ambient temperature was increased from 28 to 43C and maintained at this level for 1.5-2.0 hours. Increases in cardiac output were small, variable (ranging from 0.3 to 1.8 liters/min.), and were caused by small increases both in heart rate and stroke volume. The greater cardiac output was temporally related more closely to the augmented stroke volume which was, in turn, closely related to cutaneous vadodilatation as demonstrated by the cutaneous opacity pulses, the implication being that the augmented stroke volume probably results from the greater cutaneous venous return. The ratio of increase in cardiac output to sweating was about the same as previously shown; changes in oral temperature were small in all subjects, averaging about 0.5F. Validation of the electrical impedance technic as a measure of right ventricular stroke output was accomplished in dogs through comparisons of pulmonary arterial blood flow (electromagnetic flowmeter) and dye dilution (cardiogreen) cardiac output with that obtained by the impedance method. The correlations between the three methods were 0.792 and 0.916, respectively. (Author).') ;

Angela Douglas distills the vast literature in entomology and microbiology, as well as the burgeoning microbiome literature, to explore the full scope of insect-microbial interactions and their applications to real-world problems in agriculture and medicine. Douglas investigates how insects acquire and support their microbial partners, and examines how microorganisms contribute to insect nutrition, the defense against natural enemies, and the detoxification of natural allelochemicals and chemical insecticides. She analyzes how beneficial microbes can be harnessed to solve real-world problems in insect pest management, including strategies to suppress the transmission of viruses and microbial disease agents by mosquitoes and other insects. She also addresses the use of insects as biomedical models for effective microbial therapies treating a range of chronic human diseases, and considers how knowledge of insect-microbial interactions can promote the health of beneficial insects, especially in the context of environmental pollutants and climate change. Insects and Their Beneficial Microbes provides a much-needed conceptual framework for the growing discipline of insect-microbial interactions, and offers a wealth of insights into insect symbioses from molecular, physiological, ecological, and evolutionary perspectives.') ;

Insert into Summary (`BookID`,`Summary`) Values ('370','Until 1860 John Ruskins writings were primarily about art and architecture; but his belief that good art can flourish only in a society that is sound and healthy led him inevitably to a preoccupation with social and economic problems, the dominant concern of his later writings. James Clark Sherburne provides in this volume a detailed and long overdue re-examination of Ruskins social and economic perceptions and, for the first time, systematically places these perceptions in their nineteenth-century intellectual context. Ruskins eloquence and the strength of his moral, aesthetic, and social convictions established him as one of the most influential of Victorian writers. His writings, however, are not easily categorized and many of his important insights occur as digressions in discussions of other topics. Mr. Sherburne succeeds in ordering and clarifying the rich chaos of Ruskins social thought without denying that wholeness which is, paradoxically, its salient feature. He discovers the source of Ruskins social criticism in his early writings. He then follows Ruskins interest as it shifts from economic theory to the problems of exploitation, war, imperialism, the means of social reform, and the construction of the welfare state. Ruskins remarkably early vision of the possibility of economic abundance, his anticipation of its social and personal implications, his much disparaged critique of classical economics, his pioneering attention to the role of the consumer and the quality of consumption, his anxious portrayal of the effects of industrialism on the environment, his critique of English educational methods, and his farsighted proposals for public management of industry and transport are among the many aspects of Ruskins thought examined by Mr. Sherburne. What emerges is an original and exhaustive study of a dimension of Ruskins work which, though much neglected, is particularly relevant to contemporary concerns.') ;

K-wire implants are extremely versatile in their usage and can treat fractures of various kinds in most of the bones from finger tips to toes. Due to their remarkable ability to heal and reconstruct intricate bone fractures, they are a popular choice among orthopedic surgeons the world over.

Given the trend towards regionalization of economic ties across the world, especially after the successful launch of the euro, a detailed analysis of the WAMZ is needed. As this is the first book on monetary and financial integration in Gambia, Ghana, Guinea, Nigeria and Sierra Leone, it is an essential read for anyone interested in economic development in West Africa, and indeed in Africa as a whole. This book is extremely well-researched, with detail on virtually all aspects of economic integration in the region; with issues ranging from the institutional details of integration, trade and financial market integration, to progress on convergence of macroeconomic fundamentals to the required payments system infrastructure. The book deploys solid empirical facts and sophisticated analyses to thoroughly defend its assertions. This collection is a valuable contribution and an excellent companion book for monetary economics or international economics classes as well as African development literature. It will provide students and researchers with an exciting chance to apply concepts of, for example, optimum currency areas, central bank structure or monetary policy approaches, to a real-world case of potential monetary union. Dr. Temitope W. Oshikoya and his collaborators have written the authoritative book on the subject of monetary union in the West African Monetary Zone. As is evident in the level of detail of the book, Dr. Oshikoya brings rich field experience from his role as Director General and CEO of the West African Monetary Institute. This book will be of interest to postgraduates and researchers in development economics; as well as policymakers, monetary authorities and development practitioners.') ;

In Movies, Songs, and Electric Sound, Charles O’Brien examines American and European musical films created circa 1930, when the world’s sound-equipped theaters screened movies featuring recorded songs and filmmakers in the United States and Europe struggled to meet the artistic and technical challenges of sound production and distribution. The presence of singers in films exerted special pressures on film technique, lending a distinct look and sound to the films’ musical sequences. Rather than advancing a film’s plot, songs in these films were staged, filmed, and cut to facilitate the singer’s engagement with her or his public. Through an examination of the export market for sound films in the early 1930s, when German and American companies used musical films as a vehicle for competing to control the world film trade, this book delineates a new transnational context for understanding the Hollywood musical. Combining archival research with the cinemetric analysis of hundreds of American, German, French, and British films made between 1927 and 1934, O’Brien provides the historical context necessary for making sense of the aesthetic impact of changes in film technology from the past to the present.') ;

They focus on the interactive scaffolding of the weak components of the childs functional systems, the transition from joint child-adult co-actions, and the emotional involvement of the child. The authors discuss effective ways to remediate issues with attention, executive functions (working memory and cognitive control) and spatial and visual-verbal functions. Overcoming Learning Disabilities translates complex problems into easily understandable concepts useful to school psychologists, special and general education teachers, and parents of children with learning disabilities.') ;

He made significant contributions to almost every area of analytic philosophy including metaphysics, philosophy of language, philosophy of mind, and philosophy of science, and set the agenda for various debates in these areas which carry on to this day. In several respects he remains a contemporary figure, yet enough time has now passed for historians of philosophy to begin to study his place in twentieth century thought. His philosophy was constructed and refined not just through his published writing, but also crucially through his life-long correspondence with fellow philosophers, including leading figures such as D.M. Armstrong, Saul Kripke, W.V. Quine, J.J.C. Smart, and Peter van Inwagen. His letters formed the undercurrent of his published work and became the medium through which he proposed many of his well-known theories and discussed a range of philosophical topics in depth. A selection of his vast correspondence over a 40-year period is presented here across two volumes. As metaphysics is arguably where Lewis made his greatest contribution, this forms the focus of Volume 1. Arranged under the broad areas of Causation, Modality, and Ontology, the letters offer an organic story of the origins, development, breadth, and depth of his metaphysics in its historical context, as well as a glimpse into the influence of his many interlocutors. This volume will be an indispensable resource for contemporary metaphysics and for those interested in the Lewisian perspective.') ;

Addressing the potential for confusion about basic Christian claims and beliefs, Gerald OCollins sets out to relaunch fundamental theology as a discipline by presenting a coherent vision of basic theological questions and positions that lay the ground for work in specific areas of systematic theology. Rethinking Fundamental Theology examines central theological questions: about God, human experience and, specifically, religious experience; the divine revelation coming through the history of Israel and through the life, death and resurrection of Jesus; human faith that responds to revelation; the nature of tradition that transmits the record and reality of revelation; the structure of biblical inspiration and truth, as well as basic issues concerned with the formation of the canon; the founding of the Church with some leadership structures; the relationship between Christs revelation and the faith of those who follow other religions. OCollins concludes with some reflections on theological method. Written with the scholarship and accessibility for which OCollins is known and valued, this book will relaunch fundamental theology as a distinct and necessary discipline in faculties and departments of theology and religious studies around the world.') ;

The model predicts that information sharing of signals within social groups can facilitate information aggregation when the social groups are sufficiently large even when it is not predicted with individual signals. We use experiments in the laboratory and on Amazon Mechanical Turk to test these predictions. We find that information sharing in social groups significantly affects citizens protest decisions and as a consequence mitigates the effects of high conflict, leading to greater efficiency in policy makers choices. Our experiments highlight that social media can play an important role in protests beyond simply a way in which citizens can coordinate their actions; and indeed that the information aggregation and the coordination motives behind public protests are intimately connected and cannot be conceptually separated.') ;

Containing more than 35 stories from the early masters of fantasy literature, the narratives here transport the reader to alternate worlds where magic abounds, cosmic terrors lie around the corner and intrepid heroes fight for justice. Drawing inspiration from Norse, Japanese and Chinese mythology as well as from traditional fairytales and modern fears, the authors collected here span the breadth of the genre. Including tales from William Morris, H. G. Wells, Robert E. Howard and H. P. Lovecraft amongst others, they demonstrate the plethora of imaginative literature that was written in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Many of these tales were foundational works, bringing ideas of the supernatural into the mainstream, and through their efforts creating entirely new genres. Before Tolkien, there were many writers embracing the realm of fantastic fiction. The man responsible for its origin was George MacDonald (1824-1905), a Calvinist minister and Celtic scholar, who wrote the first true fantasy novel. He was followed by a number of imaginative successors at the end of the 19th century, including H. G. Wells, Arthur Machen, and Ernest Bramah. After the end of World War I, the pulp magazines opened up the genre to a new generation of writers - particularly H. P. Lovecraft and Robert E. Howard - who provided exciting, magical and horrifying tales that fascinated a multitude of readers. By the outbreak of World War II, the outlines of the fantasy genre had been sketched out by these pioneers, and an entirely new type of fiction had been created. This collection includes stories by: Robert E. Howard H. P. Lovecraft G. G. Pendarves H. G. Wells William Morris Lafcadio Hearn Abraham Merritt Arthur Machen Ernest Bramah Robert W.

The title contests the notions that science alone can provide us with the most objective truth about the world, and that artistic endeavour can produce nothing more valuable than entertainment. O’Hear argues that art and the study of art are not indispensable aspects of human life, and that this is equally as important as the investigation of the natural world.') ;

Most likely you will not find this information anywhere on this book section on any other book store. I have paid thousands of dollars on exclusive groups and paid forums to collect the information presented in this book. As you can imagine these are the highly guarded secrets of the elite of the FOREX traders, no one gives their living away, unless you pay them a price worth their living. However I have decided to make this information for ridiculously low price, because I am fed up with the brokers and the big banks taking advantage of the regular retail trader. Let me ask you a question? When was the last time you make money with FOREX? Even further more how much money you are willing to lose, until you give up? How long you will continue to give your hard earned money to the broker? Just like you I started 5 years ago with high hopes of quitting my job and leaving the live I deserve with FOREX. My hopes and aspirations were quickly crashed and my dreams went to the dump. First I lost 1000, then 5000, 10k , how much longer I could continue like that, how much longer I could endure the ridicule the jokes of my family and the frown on the face of my wife. It was painful, sitting all day in front of the computer, until you cant see any longer and everything including the platform and your mind become blurry. I know the pain I have been there. This continued for year, until one morning I was ready to quit, I was going to give it a last try and throw that FOREX staff in the garbage, out the window. I stumbled on a rear tread, which since then has been banned, by the broker that was holding the forum. Luckily the tread continued under the brokers radar for while, and gathered a bunch of comments an support. Finally the tread from the trader X was discontinued. I was in dis pare, that was the only hope and light, I have seen for a long time. I was applying the advice from the trade and things were starting to work for me. Fortunately I was able to PM the trader and begged him to agree on a 20 min conversation on the phone. Trader X was not a guru, not your regular internet promoter mojo. He was quietly raking in thousands of dollars a month for years, he was not excited about the next trade, his heart beat was not raising before he pooled the trigger. See, he has been doing this trading staff for so long it has become a boring procedure, rather a morning an afternoon chore, something like putting the garbage out on garbage day. He explained that he learned from the MASTER, I did not proceed to ask him who was the MASTER, since I mainly was concerned with him teaching him every little bit of what he knew about trading. He didnt not agree to spend time teaching me on our first conversation, regardless of how much I offered to pay him. See, for him money was not a issue. Finally on my third approach he agreed to show me what the MASTER had thought him many years ago. What is comprised in the pages of this book will be worth pure gold to you.This book is down to the ground no no sense, real trading knowledge. It gives step by step instructions with real trade examples. This book is not your regular hog wash advice that you will find from your broker and the other magic bullets and seven step series that you see on this site. This book teaches you how to trade like the pros. Shows you how the big banks and foreign nationals and institution trade. The book opens your eyes to how to piggy back on the big institutional traders and win. Ninety Five percent of the people that trade the Forex market lose money and give up. The market is continually replaced by fresh blood like yourself. Dont become part of the statistics, read this book and get a map to success in FOREX. You can make a success in FOREX if you know what you are doing. Yes you can make a living with FOREX and quit your job. You can achieve your dreams. Buy this book and find out How?') ;

But because it has done so much important ideological work for the people who have written about it, the historical roots of the discourse have been obscured from view. What did it mean to talk about messiahs in the ancient world, before the idea of messianism became a philosophical juggernaut, dictating the terms for all subsequent discussion of the topic? In this book, Matthew V. Novenson offers a revisionist account of messianism in antiquity. He shows that, for the ancient Jews and Christians who used the term, a messiah was not an article of faith but a manner of speaking. It was a scriptural figure of speech, one among numerous others, useful for thinking about kinds of political order: present or future, real or ideal, monarchic or theocratic, dynastic or charismatic, and other variations besides. The early Christians famously seized upon the title messiah (in Greek, Christ) for their founding hero and molded the sense of the term in certain ways; but, Novenson shows, this is just what all ancient messiah texts do, each in its own way. If we hope to understand the ancient texts about messiahs (from Deutero-Isaiah to the Parables of Enoch, from the Qumran Community Rule to the Gospel of John, from the Pseudo-Clementines to Sefer Zerubbabel), we must learn to think not in terms of a world-historical idea but of a language game, of so many creative reuses of an archaic Israelite idiom.

Psychological first aid, or PFA, is designed to mitigate the effects of acute stress and trauma and assist those in crisis to cope effectively with adversity. PFA is designed to be applied in emergencies, including disasters and terrorist attacks. In this essential guide, George S. Everly, Jr., developer of the Johns Hopkins RAPID PFA method, and Jeffrey M. Lating, his collaborator in its implementation, describe the principles and practices underpinning this psychological model in an easy-to-follow, prescriptive, and practical manner. They explain the history of PFA and persuasively demonstrate its powerful versatility. Mental health practitioners can apply PFA in all settings. It can also be used as a public-health tool to address mental health needs following critical incidents and as a means for building community resilience. Aimed at mental health practitioners, all first responders, and global health disaster teams such as Médecins Sans Frontières and the World Health Organization, The Johns Hopkins Guide to Psychological First Aid is the first book to thoroughly explain RAPID PFA. RAPID, a unique theoretically grounded and evidence-based PFA method, follows a set of easily understood principles. In each chapter, Everly and Lating provide a step-by-step approach and include a key point summary to emphasize essential elements. A unifying case exemplifies each phase of the RAPID PFA model in an ongoing dialogue that presents ideal PFA responses, examples of common mistakes, and various outcomes. In addition to their counseling experience in Kuwait after the Gulf War and in New York City after the September 11 attacks, the authors have traveled nationally and internationally to teach the RAPID PFA method in numerous public health, fire, police, military, and faith-based settings. Beneficial to those with little or no previous mental health training, this book is an essential tool for people who want to learn, to practice, or to retain their ability to use psychological first aid effectively.') ;

Lating, his collaborator in its implementation, describe the principles and practices underpinning this psychological model in an easy-to-follow, prescriptive, and practical manner. They explain the history of PFA and persuasively demonstrate its powerful versatility. Mental health practitioners can apply PFA in all settings. It can also be used as a public-health tool to address mental health needs following critical incidents and as a means for building community resilience. Aimed at mental health practitioners, all first responders, and global health disaster teams such as Médecins Sans Frontières and the World Health Organization, The Johns Hopkins Guide to Psychological First Aid is the first book to thoroughly explain RAPID PFA. RAPID, a unique theoretically grounded and evidence-based PFA method, follows a set of easily understood principles. In each chapter, Everly and Lating provide a step-by-step approach and include a key point summary to emphasize essential elements. A unifying case exemplifies each phase of the RAPID PFA model in an ongoing dialogue that presents ideal PFA responses, examples of common mistakes, and various outcomes. In addition to their counseling experience in Kuwait after the Gulf War and in New York City after the September 11 attacks, the authors have traveled nationally and internationally to teach the RAPID PFA method in numerous public health, fire, police, military, and faith-based settings. Beneficial to those with little or no previous mental health training, this book is an essential tool for people who want to learn, to practice, or to retain their ability to use psychological first aid effectively.') ;

I knew I had the beginning of a great thing, a great truth in architecture. -Frank Lloyd Wright Early on the morning of June 4, 1905, lightning struck the steeple of Unity Church in the Chicago suburb of Oak Park, igniting a fire that would raze the building to the ground. The Unitarian congregation suddenly needed a home and turned to local architect Frank Lloyd Wright for a new approach. Thus begins the story of a watershed moment in the career of the worlds most influential architect and in the history of twentieth-century architecture and design. Wrights design for Unity Temple was radical in its simplicity-a monolithic concrete exterior-yet sublime in its detail and revolutionary in its use of interior space. With Wrights execution of Unity Temple, the ideas hed been working on and experimenting with for years were finally brought to fruition, and modern design was born. But it might never have happened if not for a devoted Unitarian congregation who embraced Wrights ideas and remained faithful to the architect and his vision through the trials and calamities of construction. Unity Temple, when completed in 1909, was-and still is-considered one of the landmarks of modern architecture. Author David M. Sokol poured more than 20 years of research into The Noble Room and uncovers a dramatic tale-much of which turns out to be at odds with the accepted story of how Wright himself described the process. Anyone with an interest in architecture or in Frank Lloyd Wright-or indeed anyone whos ever had an addition put on to their house or a kitchen remodeled-will be caught up in the story of the tumultuous, chaotic creation of a modern masterpiece, which comes to life in The Noble Room.') ;

Its time to fight back Shame is a powerful and sometimes useful tool. When we publicly shame corrupt politicians, abusive celebrities, or predatory corporations, we reinforce values of fairness and justice. But as best-selling author Cathy ONeil argues in this revelatory book, shaming has taken a new and dangerous turn. It is increasingly being weaponized -- used as a way to shift responsibility for social problems from institutions to individuals. Shaming children for not being able to afford school lunches or adults for not being able to find work lets us off the hook as a society. After all, why pay higher taxes to fund programmes for people who are fundamentally unworthy? ONeil explores the machinery behind all this shame, showing how governments, corporations and the healthcare system capitalize on it. There are damning stories of rehab clinics, reentry programs, drug and diet companies, and social media platforms -- all of which profit from punching down on the vulnerable. Woven throughout The Shame Machine is the story of ONeils own struggle with body image and her recent weight-loss surgery, which awakened her to the systematic shaming of fat people seeking medical care. With clarity and nuance, ONeil dissects the relationship between shame and power. Whom does the system serve? How do current incentive structures perpetuate the shaming cycle? And, most important, how can we all fight back?') ;

Spiritual devotions, or the three spiritual disciplines comprise Bible reading, prayer and pondering the word of God, or what we call godly meditation. This meditation is the musing and mental study of heavenly truths. It is working the practical truths of the Bible into one’s soul. In this, Christians are captivated with God’s disclosure of heavenly truths to them in the bible. In the bible God displays himself to them. God is the infinite First-being, worthy of all love for Himself, and communicates that love to His people. They in turn love him back. Loving him back includes thinking about him. Though Christians live in the world, they have communion with the God of heaven through the word of God, throughout the whole course of their lives. They do this through godly meditation. Allestree not only shows what meditation is, and how it is to be done, but gives the reader twenty-eight meditations so that he can enter into a profitable time of daily meditation by practical example.

With The Jazz Singer he supervised the innovation of film sound. With The Public Enemy and Little Caesar he reinvented the gangster film. With 42nd Street he reinvigorated the musical. He set the standard for film biography with pictures such as Young Mr. Lincoln and The Story of Alexander Graham Bell . He innovated CinemaScope. And he molded the star images of James Cagney, Shirley Temple, Tyrone Power, Betty Grable, Marilyn Monroe, and Rin Tin Tin.In this major new biography, George F. Custen illuminates Zanucks evolution into one of the most influential producers in American film. He explains what set him apart from rivals Irving Thalberg and David O. Selznick, how he developed the gritty realism that came to redefine motion pictures, and how he brilliantly predicted and capitalized on changing public tastes.Zanuck was a man of enormous energy and eccentricity, commanding his studio with a sawed-off polo mallet. Dozens of his memorable films—including I Am a Fugitive from a Chain Gang , The Grapes of Wrath, Gentlemans Agreement, All About Eve, The Day the Earth Stood Still , and The Robe —have come to represent the era in which they were made. Hard-boiled or nostalgic, historical or pure Hollywood, Zanucks films and Zanuck himself have become legends of the cinema. But what exactly was this producers contribution to the films he made? How did he rise from being a writer of silent serials to become head of production at Warner Brothers by his mid-twenties, and then to form his own studio, Twentieth Century-Fox at age thirty-three?Twentieth Centurys Fox tells the whole story—from Zanucks boyhood to his tumultuous years with the feuding Warners, his battles with the censors and with his own actors, and the legendary acting-out of scenes during story conferences in his famous green office. Along the way, Custen treats us to inside stories about actors such as Edward G. Robinson, Gregory Peck, and Marilyn Monroe. In never-before-published story conference notes, telegrams, and surprisingly candid anecdotes, he reveals how—more than any producer before or since—this diminutive, enigmatic fellow from Wahoo, Nebraska, changed the way we look at film.Custen highlights the studio as the context of production. Zanucks ability to shape the producers role and the organizational style during the golden years of the studio system—with its own peculiar methods, clearly delineated rules, and pecking order—was the crucible out of which he forged a unique vision of American film and American culture.') ;

In today’s economy, we have far too much dismay along with our amazement, and technology bears some of the blame. In this combination of memoir, business strategy guide, and call to action, Tim OReilly, Silicon Valley’s leading intellectual and the founder of O’Reilly Media, explores the upside and the potential downsides of todays WTF? technologies. What is the future when an increasing number of jobs can be performed by intelligent machines instead of people, or done only by people in partnership with those machines? What happens to our consumer based societies—to workers and to the companies that depend on their purchasing power? Is income inequality and unemployment an inevitable consequence of technological advancement, or are there paths to a better future? What will happen to business when technology-enabled networks and marketplaces are better at deploying talent than traditional companies? How should companies organize themselves to take advantage of these new tools? What’s the future of education when on-demand learning outperforms traditional institutions? How can individuals continue to adapt and retrain? Will the fundamental social safety nets of the developed world survive the transition, and if not, what will replace them? OReilly is the man who can really can make a whole industry happen, according to Eric Schmidt, Executive Chairman of Alphabet (Google.) His genius over the past four decades has been to identify and to help shape our response to emerging technologies with world shaking potential—the World Wide Web, Open Source Software, Web 2.0, Open Government data, the Maker Movement, Big Data, and now AI. O’Reilly shares the techniques hes used at O’Reilly Media to make sense of and predict past innovation waves and applies those same techniques to provide a framework for thinking about how today’s world-spanning platforms and networks, on-demand services, and artificial intelligence are changing the nature of business, education, government, financial markets, and the economy as a whole. He provides tools for understanding how all the parts of modern digital businesses work together to create marketplace advantage and customer value, and why ultimately, they cannot succeed unless their ecosystem succeeds along with them. The core of the books call to action is an exhortation to businesses to DO MORE with technology rather than just using it to cut costs and enrich their shareholders. Robots are going to take our jobs, they say. OReilly replies, “Only if that’s what we ask them to do! Technology is the solution to human problems, and we won’t run out of work till we run out of problems. Entrepreneurs need to set their sights on how they can use big data, sensors, and AI to create amazing human experiences and the economy of the future, making us all richer in the same way the tools of the first industrial revolution did. Yes, technology can eliminate labor and make things cheaper, but at its best, we use it to do things that were previously unimaginable! What is our poverty of imagination? What are the entrepreneurial leaps that will allow us to use the technology of today to build a better future, not just a more efficient one?

Στο πρώτο μέρος του βιβλίου με τίτλο «Πορτρέτο ενός αόρατου ανθρώπου», ο συγγραφέας αποκαλύπτει τις αναμνήσεις και τα συναισθήματά του μετά τον θάνατο του πατέρα του – ενός απόμακρου, ελάχιστα εκδηλωτικού, σχεδόν ψυχρού ανθρώπου. Καθώς φροντίζει για τις υποθέσεις του πατέρα του και σκαλίζει τα υπάρχοντά του, ο Auster ανακαλύπτει ένα οικογενειακό μυστικό: έναν φόνο που χρονολογείται εξήντα χρόνια πριν, ο οποίος θα φωτίσει τον απροσδιόριστο χαρακτήρα του πατέρα του. Στο δεύτερο μέρος, με τίτλο το «Βιβλίο της μνήμης», η οπτική γωνία μετατοπίζεται από την ταυτότητα του Auster ως γιου στον ρόλο του ως πατέρα.

With a step-by-step approach, the book leads readers through the process of modeling human figures, with specific yet flexible techniques that can be applied to many different hardware/software setups. Separate chapters cover different areas of the body, and contain everything readers need to know about proportion, basic design strategies, 3-D construction methods, and other essential information. The final chapters show how to prepare figures for animation and get them up and running-and jumping, walking, turning, and twisting!

Officers and men of the navys four-piper destroyers began by investigating circumstances on the ground in mainland Turkey right after World War I, and by transporting American relief teams to ports throughout Turkey and Southern Russia to aid the tens of thousands of orphans and refugees who had survived the wartime Armenian genocide. Then the destroyers assisted in the final evacuation of 150,000 White Russians from the Crimea to Constantinople (one of the final acts of the Russian Revolution); coordinated the visits of the Hoover grain ships to ports in Southern Russia where millions were enduring a horrendous famine; witnessed and reported on the terrible dolorosa of the Greeks of the Pontus regious of Turkey; and, in September of 1922, conducted the evacuation of hundreds of thousands of Greek and Armenian refugees from burning Smyrna. This latter event was the cataclysmic conclusion of the Turkish Nationalist Revolutino, which had begun in early 1920. After Smyrna, the destroyers escorted Greek steamers in their rescue of ethnic Christian civilians being expelled from all the ports of Anatolian Turkey. As the conclusion of a long war between Nationalist Turks and an invading Hellenic Greek army, these people were being forced out of their ancestral homes by the Turks. Sometimes American destroyers carried hundreds of such refugees to friendly ports on their own weather decks. Upon the burning of Smyrna of September of 1922, Admiral Mark Bristols small fleet had grown to some 26 naval vessels, most of them destroyers, although some cruisers, naval repair vessels and supply ships also came, and the battleships Arizona and Utah also appeared briefly. It was during 1922 that the destroyer BAinbridge rescued 482 of 495 men, women and children from the burning French transport Vinh Long in teh Sea of Marmora. The destroyer accomplished this by the expedient of ramming the large French ship so the exploding ammunition could not continue to force the vessels apart. For this action, Lieut.Commander W. Atlee Edwards was awarded the Medal of Honor by America, and the Legion of Honor by France. Over four years, Admiral Bristol maintained a strong grip on American naval and diplomatic affairs throughout the region. Headquartered at the American Embassy at Constantinople, Bristol also worked to further American business interests in Turkey, and tended to favor Turks over Greeks and Armenians in the process. Many Americans were convinced that Bristol was biased on behalf of the Turks, and a couple of navy captains risked their careers by speaking out about impending Turkish massacres that Bristol wanted to hush up.') ;

Despite major advances in the understanding of the pathophysiology of angina in recent years and a multitude of studies on the subject, the cause and mechanisms underlying the syndrome of angina with normal coronary arteries remain unknown. Indeed, results of investigations are controversial and speculation still prevails regarding the nature of the so called `Syndrome X. Almost every important aspect of Syndrome X has been tackled in the book and the reader is exposed not only to the cardiologists opinion, but also to the authoritative views of the gastroenterologists, gynaecologists and psychiatrists, extremely well represented in this monograph. The book deals with `cardiologists Syndrome X and not the metabolic entity termed `Syndrome X. The possible connection between the two, however, is discussed.

Bedes Temple: An Image and its Interpretation examines Bedes use of the temple to reveal his ideas of history, the universe, Christ, the Church, and the individual Christian. Across his wide body of writings Bede presented an image of unity, whether that be the unity of Jew and gentile in the universal Church, or the unity of human and divine in the incarnate Christ, and the temple-image provided a means of understanding and celebrating that unity. Conor OBrien argues that Bedes understanding of the temple was part of the shared spirituality and communal discourse of his monastery at Wearmouth-Jarrow, in particular as revealed in the great illuminated Bible made there: the Codex Amiatinus. Studying the temple in Bedes works reveals not just an individual genius, but a monastic community engaged actively in scriptural interpretation and religious reflection.

Insert into Summary (`BookID`,`Summary`) Values ('959','The service life of Virginias concrete bridge decks is generally controlled by chloride-induced corrosion of the reinforcing steel as a result of the application of winter maintenance deicing salts. A chloride corrosion model accounting for the variable input parameters using Monte Carlo resampling was developed. The model was validated using condition surveys from 10 Virginia bridge decks built with bare steel. The influence of changes in the construction specifications of w/c = 0.47 and 0.45 and w/cm = 0.45 and a cover depth increase from 2 to 2.75 inches was determined. Decks built under the specification of w/cm = 0.45 (using slag or fly ash) and a 2.75 inch cover depth have a maintenance free service life of greater than 100 years, regardless of the type of reinforcing steel. Galvanized, MMFX-2, and stainless steel, in order of increasing reliability of a service life of greater than 100 years, will provide a redundant corrosion protection system.

All engineers concerned with the impact of their work and that should be all engineers must read this book. Hal Abelson, professor of computer science and engineering, MIT Code is law.

Insert into Summary (`BookID`,`Summary`) Values ('997','This book offers a systematic treatment--the first in book form--of the development and use of cohomological induction to construct unitary representations. George Mackey introduced induction in 1950 as a real analysis construction for passing from a unitary representation of a closed subgroup of a locally compact group to a unitary representation of the whole group. Later a parallel construction using complex analysis and its associated co-homology theories grew up as a result of work by Borel, Weil, Harish-Chandra, Bott, Langlands, Kostant, and Schmid. Cohomological induction, introduced by Zuckerman, is an algebraic analog that is technically more manageable than the complex-analysis construction and leads to a large repertory of irreducible unitary representations of reductive Lie groups. The book, which is accessible to students beyond the first year of graduate school, will interest mathematicians and physicists who want to learn about and take advantage of the algebraic side of the representation theory of Lie groups. Cohomological Induction and Unitary Representations develops the necessary background in representation theory and includes an introductory chapter of motivation, a thorough treatment of the translation principle, and four appendices on algebra and analysis.') ;

He seeks to investigate what is to him the most intriguing and interesting subject--the multifaceted operations of man in his natural environment. The predicament lies in the discrepancy between the complexity and richness of mans subjective experience, and the pallid analog of these experiences the psychologist is able to study effectively with the research procedures available to him. In Concepts of Personality Joseph M. Wepman and Ralph W. Heine offer a comprehensive survey of classical and contemporary personality theory, including a wide array of examples of these two trends. If the psychologist holds to the premises of strict objectivity through controlled observations, he finds himself driven to the periphery of the very problem he seeks to understand. This is a place where the reliability of measurement and the validity and predictability of his instruments can often be specified, but only at the cost of abandoning the goal of useful generality or of application to the individual in his ordinary life circumstances. Concepts of Personality, unlike most books on the subject, is not limited to broad, general theories.

Insert into Summary (`BookID`,`Summary`) Values ('1022','The psychologist who pursues an interest in personality is constantly faced by a dilemma. He seeks to investigate what is to him the most intriguing and interesting subject--the multifaceted operations of man in his natural environment. The predicament lies in the discrepancy between the complexity and richness of mans subjective experience, and the pallid analog of these experiences the psychologist is able to study effectively with the research procedures available to him. In Concepts of Personality Joseph M. Wepman and Ralph W. Heine offer a comprehensive survey of classical and contemporary personality theory, including a wide array of examples of these two trends. If the psychologist holds to the premises of strict objectivity through controlled observations, he finds himself driven to the periphery of the very problem he seeks to understand. This is a place where the reliability of measurement and the validity and predictability of his instruments can often be specified, but only at the cost of abandoning the goal of useful generality or of application to the individual in his ordinary life circumstances. Concepts of Personality, unlike most books on the subject, is not limited to broad, general theories. It includes chapters on basic processes--learning, perception, genetics, and drive theory; on the major analytical approaches of psychology and psychiatry; on anthropological and sociological contributions; and on the problems of measurement and assessment.

Jerome Delaney, a professor of educational administration and former high school principal, answers the big questions about education policy in this powerful and practical primer for students. Informed by his experience in the public school system, Delaney takes a pragmatic and realistic approach that divides a complicated subject into manageable sub-topics. He grounds the debate at the classroom level: after all, that’s where the effects of high-level policy decisions ultimately play out. Starting from the basics and progressing through to the deeper aspects of education policy, this text provides an excellent introduction to a subject that lies at the foundation of every education system. This second edition includes a new chapter on issues relating to policy implementation, as well as new discussion questions at the end of each chapter. Topics include: A beginner’s overview of education policy studies. How values influence policy-making. How education policy is developed, implemented, and evaluated. The role of policy in education reform. The future of education policy as schools adapt to changing societies.') ;

Feature of this book is-- 1) Learn C++ without fear, 2) This book is for everyone, 3) 160 End of book examples, 4) 200 Practical Codes, 5) At last it goes to Expert level topics such as: *Software Design & Development Using C++*, 6) 101 Rules, for Software Design & Development using C++ @ the end of this book. 7) Very Easy Definitions for each topic with code examples and output. While reading this book it is fun and easy to read it. This book is best suitable for first time C++ readers, Covers all fast track topics of C++ for all Computer Science students and Professionals. This book introduces standard C++ and the key programming and design techniques supported by C++. Standard C++ is a far more powerful and polished language than the version of C++ introduced by the first edition of this book. This book presents every major C++ language feature and the standard library. It is organized around language and library facilities. However, features are presented in the context of their use. That is, the focus is on the language as the tool for design and programming rather than on the language in itself. This book demonstrates key techniques that make C++ effective and teaches the fundamental concepts necessary for mastery. As everyone knows that Author Harry is basically known for his Easy way- Programming without fear technique. His book presents world’s easiest definitions and codes for beginners. || Inside Chapters. || 1 (Introduction To C++ Programming) 2 (Inside The C++ Language) 3 (Pointers & References) 4 (Understanding Functions) 5 (Structure-Unions-Enumerated Data Types) 6 (Object Oriented Programming Concept) 7 (C++ Classes and Objects) 8 (Constructors and Destructors) 9 (Operator Overloading) 10 (Console Input / Output Streams) 11 (Inheritance Concept in C++) 12 (Virtual Functions-Polymorphism Concept) 13 (Templates Concept In C++) 14 (Exception Handling In C++) 15 (New Features of ANSI C++ Standard) 16 (Working With Files) 17 (String Classes’) 18 (Your Brain On C++ ( 160 Multiple Choice Questions)) 19 (Your Brain On C++ (100 Practical Programming Questions)) 20 (Software Design & Development Using C++)') ;

The canopy-flat-pattern sweep angles investigated on the 550 swept wing were 42.50, 450, 47.50, 500, and 52.50. Several other modifications to the canopy shape were also studied, such as removal of single, double, and compound gores from the rear part of each canopy lobe. A study of the effects of wing-leading-edge sweep angle was made between sweep angles of 500 and 600 and effects of leading-edge diameter were obtained at the basic 550 sweep angle. Effects of keel web height were determined for a constant trailing-edge length and also for trailing-edge lengths that varied with web height.') ;

You may be mad at me at this moment,but soon will come the moment you will thank me .Or you would rather stumble on a nice guru telling you all the lies, and how he can help you open a 10k account with a secret advantage.

Things I overheard on the golf course? Tell me about that, one of the guys I used to golf with executed only one trade a month, we used to call him the ONE TRADE GUY...How ridiculous that is? Hanging around,playing golf all month until a certain currency goes to a such and such monthly level, and pull the trigger to wipe out all the people with red eyes staring at the screens day and night,fighting with their spouses,wasting their lives in front of the broker platforms.I know what you are thinking this guy is full of it!Well, I am fed up with the usual story that hits every newbie trader like you and I dont want you to have anything to do with it.So, I am giving you a choice: take this book read it, study and devour every single strategy (however dont choke take it step by step), because its real, truth coming from a real trader (I wish I could stretch my hand over the monitor,I promise you! You could touch me.)Take the leap of faith;you are a couple mouse clicks away from finding the real freedom and trading like a pro. Take the click of faith! See you on the other side!Trader X') ;

First, it is written to address the needs of both the experienced practitioner and the entry-level public servant. Case examples bridge the content-rich environment of practitioners with the principles of public administration sought by pre-service students. Second, the discussion of management practices is grounded in the political and ethical tensions inherent in the American constitutional form of governance. This innovative approach reflects the authors belief that public administration operates as an integral part of the countrys political traditions, and thereby helps define the political culture. Key themes in this third edition include: - An emphasis on the ways in which public administration and their agents play a critical role in ensuring legal and political accountability of the political system. - An exploration of local public administration as the backstop of American democracy, requiring a close working partnership between part-time elected officials and career administrators. - Careful examination of the ways in which American political economy requires administrators who are skilled at co-producing the common good with voluntary associations, businesses, nonprofit organizations and other governmental entities. - An understanding that public administration plays a critical role with its prudential judgments in balancing the competing values necessary to secure a regime of ordered liberty. Every chapter has been thoroughly updated, with particular attention paid to chapters on budgeting and revenue, e-government and the digital divide, shared power and the rise of wicked problems,  and the future of public administration in the United States amidst deep polarization. Foundations of Public Service, 3rd Edition provides a framework for understanding American political traditions and how they inform public administration as a political practice.

The program requires that the user supply input information such as the first and last channels of the region, the channels to be used as pre- and post-region background, the system gain and zero-intercept, and a list of approximate energy values at which peaks occur in the region. Because the peak position and peak-shape parameters enter nonlinearly into the peak-fitting algorithm, an iterative least-square procedure is used in the fitting process. The program iterates until either all convergence criteria are met or ten iterations have elapsed. The code described here allows for twenty free parameters and a region as large as 240 data channels. This code runs on an LSI-11 computer with 32K memory and disk-storage capability.') ;

Flannery O’Connor is a master of twentieth-century American fiction, joining, since her untimely death in 1964, the likes of Hawthorne, Hemingway, and Faulkner. Those familiar with her work know that her powerful ethical vision was rooted in a quiet, devout faith and informed all she wrote and did. Good Things Out of Nazareth, a much-anticipated collection of many of O’Connor’s previously unpublished letters—along with those of literary luminaries such as Walker Percy (The Moviegoer), Caroline Gordon (None Shall Look Back), Katherine Anne Porter (Ship of Fools), Robert Giroux and movie critic Stanley Kauffmann. The letters explore such themes as creativity, faith, suffering, and writing. Brought together, they form a riveting literary portrait of these friends, artists, and thinkers. Here we find their joys and loves, as well as their trials and tribulations as they struggle with doubt and illness while championing their beliefs and often confronting racism in American society during the civil rights era. Praise for Good Things Out of Nazareth “An epistolary group portrait that will appeal to readers interested in the Catholic underpinnings of OConnors life and work . . .

To what extent has the mass culture of the movie industry itself been conceptually shaped by a broad, external societal discourse? Norman Denzin brings to his life-long study of alcoholism a searching interest in how cultural texts signify and lend themselves to interpretation within a social nexus. Both historical and diachronic in his approach, Denzin identifies five periods in the alcoholism films made between 1932 and the end of the 1980s, and offers a detailed critical reading of thirty-seven films produced during these six decades. Professor Denzin has produced a searching and provocative interpretation of more than a half-century of Hollywoods social and personal construction of the problem drinker in America. Readable by both lay persons and specialists, Denzins book provides us with the most comprehensive understanding of this topic to date.--Stanford M. Lyman, Robert J. Morrow Eminent Scholar in Social Science, Florida Atlantic University An eminent sociologist and leading authority on alcoholism, Denzin also writes skillfully about films as films and is comfortable with postmodern interpretive theoryàa genuinely interdisciplinary work of the first order. --Robert L. Carringer, author, The Making of Citizen Kane Denzin has gone on an exhaustive bar-crawl through hundreds of movies, returning with evidence that the film about drinking is a genre of its own. He writes from sound knowledge about alcoholism--which, unlike other diseases, is frequently viewed with bittersweet romanticism.--Roger Ebert Norman K.

Increases in cardiac output were small, variable (ranging from 0.3 to 1.8 liters/min.), and were caused by small increases both in heart rate and stroke volume. The greater cardiac output was temporally related more closely to the augmented stroke volume which was, in turn, closely related to cutaneous vadodilatation as demonstrated by the cutaneous opacity pulses, the implication being that the augmented stroke volume probably results from the greater cutaneous venous return. The ratio of increase in cardiac output to sweating was about the same as previously shown; changes in oral temperature were small in all subjects, averaging about 0.5F. Validation of the electrical impedance technic as a measure of right ventricular stroke output was accomplished in dogs through comparisons of pulmonary arterial blood flow (electromagnetic flowmeter) and dye dilution (cardiogreen) cardiac output with that obtained by the impedance method.

In this book, Christopher W. Hughes assesses developments in defence expenditure, civilmilitary relations, domestic and international militaryindustrial complexes, Japans procurement of regional and global power-projection capabilities, the expansion of USJapan cooperation, and attitudes towards nuclear weapons, constitutional revision and the use of military force. In all of these areas, dynamic and long-term changes outweigh Japans short-term political logjam over security policy. Hughes argues that many post-war constraints on Japans military role are still eroding, and that Tokyo is moving towards a more assertive military role and strengthened USJapan cooperation. Japans remilitarisation will boost its international security role and the dominance of the USJapan alliance in regional and global security affairs, but will need to be carefully managed if it is not to become a source of destabilising tensions.') ;

James Clark Sherburne provides in this volume a detailed and long overdue re-examination of Ruskins social and economic perceptions and, for the first time, systematically places these perceptions in their nineteenth-century intellectual context. Ruskins eloquence and the strength of his moral, aesthetic, and social convictions established him as one of the most influential of Victorian writers. His writings, however, are not easily categorized and many of his important insights occur as digressions in discussions of other topics. Mr. Sherburne succeeds in ordering and clarifying the rich chaos of Ruskins social thought without denying that wholeness which is, paradoxically, its salient feature. He discovers the source of Ruskins social criticism in his early writings. He then follows Ruskins interest as it shifts from economic theory to the problems of exploitation, war, imperialism, the means of social reform, and the construction of the welfare state. Ruskins remarkably early vision of the possibility of economic abundance, his anticipation of its social and personal implications, his much disparaged critique of classical economics, his pioneering attention to the role of the consumer and the quality of consumption, his anxious portrayal of the effects of industrialism on the environment, his critique of English educational methods, and his farsighted proposals for public management of industry and transport are among the many aspects of Ruskins thought examined by Mr. Sherburne. What emerges is an original and exhaustive study of a dimension of Ruskins work which, though much neglected, is particularly relevant to contemporary concerns.') ;

K-wire implants are extremely versatile in their usage and can treat fractures of various kinds in most of the bones from finger tips to toes. Due to their remarkable ability to heal and reconstruct intricate bone fractures, they are a popular choice among orthopedic surgeons the world over. Each reconstruction is an innovation in itself, as every complex fracture presents its unique challenges. There is a paucity of literature on standard techniques, principles and approaches to be employed for K-wiring fractures. This book fills that gap. It is the first of its kind in demonstrating the effective execution of K-wiring procedures through a lucid, case-based format. It serves as a practical guide for orthopedic surgeons on K-wiring techniques, thus enabling them to improve patient care. It will be an invaluable reference text not just for practicing orthopedic surgeons but also for subspecialists like consultant hand surgeons, foot and ankle surgeons, and microvascular plastic hand surgeons, helping them master the operative techniques related to K-wiring. Salient features: Detailed coverage of latest techniques and procedures for operating fractures with the help of K-wires Thorough descriptions of complexities encountered in all regions of the body Discussion of many cases with their management protocols Guidance for correcting mismanaged cases by using K-wires Use of excellent quality images with textual description that facilitate better relatability Extensive use of original patient photographs, radiographs, and skillfully created illustrations') ;

In fact, rational cohomology is defined in terms of K-theory.The theory is taken as far as the solution of the Hopf invariant problem and a start is mode on the J-homomorphism. In addition to the lecture notes proper, two papers of mine published since 1964 have been reproduced at the end. The first, dealing with operations, is a natural supplement to the material in Chapter III. It provides an alternative approach to operations which is less slick but more fundamental than the Grothendieck method of Chapter III, and it relates operations and filtration. Actually, the lectures deal with compact spaces, not cell-complexes, and so the skeleton-filtration does not figure in the notes. The second paper provides a new approach to K-theory and so fills an obvious gap in the lecture notes.') ;

In Movies, Songs, and Electric Sound, Charles O’Brien examines American and European musical films created circa 1930, when the world’s sound-equipped theaters screened movies featuring recorded songs and filmmakers in the United States and Europe struggled to meet the artistic and technical challenges of sound production and distribution. The presence of singers in films exerted special pressures on film technique, lending a distinct look and sound to the films’ musical sequences. Rather than advancing a film’s plot, songs in these films were staged, filmed, and cut to facilitate the singer’s engagement with her or his public. Through an examination of the export market for sound films in the early 1930s, when German and American companies used musical films as a vehicle for competing to control the world film trade, this book delineates a new transnational context for understanding the Hollywood musical. Combining archival research with the cinemetric analysis of hundreds of American, German, French, and British films made between 1927 and 1934, O’Brien provides the historical context necessary for making sense of the aesthetic impact of changes in film technology from the past to the present.') ;

In several respects he remains a contemporary figure, yet enough time has now passed for historians of philosophy to begin to study his place in twentieth century thought. His philosophy was constructed and refined not just through his published writing, but also crucially through his life-long correspondence with fellow philosophers, including leading figures such as D.M. Armstrong, Saul Kripke, W.V. Quine, J.J.C. Smart, and Peter van Inwagen. His letters formed the undercurrent of his published work and became the medium through which he proposed many of his well-known theories and discussed a range of philosophical topics in depth. A selection of his vast correspondence over a 40-year period is presented here across two volumes. As metaphysics is arguably where Lewis made his greatest contribution, this forms the focus of Volume 1.

We use experiments in the laboratory and on Amazon Mechanical Turk to test these predictions. We find that information sharing in social groups significantly affects citizens protest decisions and as a consequence mitigates the effects of high conflict, leading to greater efficiency in policy makers choices. Our experiments highlight that social media can play an important role in protests beyond simply a way in which citizens can coordinate their actions; and indeed that the information aggregation and the coordination motives behind public protests are intimately connected and cannot be conceptually separated.') ;

Our understanding in these areas has been considerably advanced and enriched by the discovery of new techniques and the sharpening of old techniques, ranging all the way from computer simulations to mode-mode coupling theories. Statistical mechanics brings together under one roof a broad spectrum of mathematical methods.

The efficiency of this reaction depends upon the APC subunit Doc1; APC that are lacking only Doc1 display significant defects in the processivity of substrate ubiquitination. Biochemical analysis indicates that Doc1 stimulates processivity by enhancing the affinity of the substrate-APC interaction. Importantly, the interaction of Cdh1 with the APC is not affected by Doc1, suggesting that Doc1 contributes to the binding of substrates to core APC subunits.') ;

The effect of training was studied by using a test-train-retest-delay-retest procedure. Performance was measured in terms of absolute error, in degrees, between the estimated direction and the correct direction. Analyses showed that average error in direction estimation using tactical maps was reduced significantly by training, dropping from a mean of 6.1 degrees before training to 4.8 degrees after training. There were also significant differences in accuracy of direction estimates as a function of map scale, distance between reference points, and compass octant in which the reference points were located.

Insert into Summary (`BookID`,`Summary`) Values ('1532','Messianism is one of the great themes in intellectual history. But because it has done so much important ideological work for the people who have written about it, the historical roots of the discourse have been obscured from view. What did it mean to talk about messiahs in the ancient world, before the idea of messianism became a philosophical juggernaut, dictating the terms for all subsequent discussion of the topic? In this book, Matthew V. Novenson offers a revisionist account of messianism in antiquity. He shows that, for the ancient Jews and Christians who used the term, a messiah was not an article of faith but a manner of speaking. It was a scriptural figure of speech, one among numerous others, useful for thinking about kinds of political order: present or future, real or ideal, monarchic or theocratic, dynastic or charismatic, and other variations besides. The early Christians famously seized upon the title messiah (in Greek, Christ) for their founding hero and molded the sense of the term in certain ways; but, Novenson shows, this is just what all ancient messiah texts do, each in its own way. If we hope to understand the ancient texts about messiahs (from Deutero-Isaiah to the Parables of Enoch, from the Qumran Community Rule to the Gospel of John, from the Pseudo-Clementines to Sefer Zerubbabel), we must learn to think not in terms of a world-historical idea but of a language game, of so many creative reuses of an archaic Israelite idiom.

Psychological first aid, or PFA, is designed to mitigate the effects of acute stress and trauma and assist those in crisis to cope effectively with adversity. PFA is designed to be applied in emergencies, including disasters and terrorist attacks. In this essential guide, George S. Everly, Jr., developer of the Johns Hopkins RAPID PFA method, and Jeffrey M. Lating, his collaborator in its implementation, describe the principles and practices underpinning this psychological model in an easy-to-follow, prescriptive, and practical manner. They explain the history of PFA and persuasively demonstrate its powerful versatility. Mental health practitioners can apply PFA in all settings. It can also be used as a public-health tool to address mental health needs following critical incidents and as a means for building community resilience. Aimed at mental health practitioners, all first responders, and global health disaster teams such as Médecins Sans Frontières and the World Health Organization, The Johns Hopkins Guide to Psychological First Aid is the first book to thoroughly explain RAPID PFA. RAPID, a unique theoretically grounded and evidence-based PFA method, follows a set of easily understood principles. In each chapter, Everly and Lating provide a step-by-step approach and include a key point summary to emphasize essential elements. A unifying case exemplifies each phase of the RAPID PFA model in an ongoing dialogue that presents ideal PFA responses, examples of common mistakes, and various outcomes. In addition to their counseling experience in Kuwait after the Gulf War and in New York City after the September 11 attacks, the authors have traveled nationally and internationally to teach the RAPID PFA method in numerous public health, fire, police, military, and faith-based settings. Beneficial to those with little or no previous mental health training, this book is an essential tool for people who want to learn, to practice, or to retain their ability to use psychological first aid effectively.') ;

I knew I had the beginning of a great thing, a great truth in architecture. -Frank Lloyd Wright Early on the morning of June 4, 1905, lightning struck the steeple of Unity Church in the Chicago suburb of Oak Park, igniting a fire that would raze the building to the ground. The Unitarian congregation suddenly needed a home and turned to local architect Frank Lloyd Wright for a new approach. Thus begins the story of a watershed moment in the career of the worlds most influential architect and in the history of twentieth-century architecture and design. Wrights design for Unity Temple was radical in its simplicity-a monolithic concrete exterior-yet sublime in its detail and revolutionary in its use of interior space. With Wrights execution of Unity Temple, the ideas hed been working on and experimenting with for years were finally brought to fruition, and modern design was born. But it might never have happened if not for a devoted Unitarian congregation who embraced Wrights ideas and remained faithful to the architect and his vision through the trials and calamities of construction. Unity Temple, when completed in 1909, was-and still is-considered one of the landmarks of modern architecture. Author David M. Sokol poured more than 20 years of research into The Noble Room and uncovers a dramatic tale-much of which turns out to be at odds with the accepted story of how Wright himself described the process. Anyone with an interest in architecture or in Frank Lloyd Wright-or indeed anyone whos ever had an addition put on to their house or a kitchen remodeled-will be caught up in the story of the tumultuous, chaotic creation of a modern masterpiece, which comes to life in The Noble Room.') ;

Its time to fight back Shame is a powerful and sometimes useful tool. When we publicly shame corrupt politicians, abusive celebrities, or predatory corporations, we reinforce values of fairness and justice. But as best-selling author Cathy ONeil argues in this revelatory book, shaming has taken a new and dangerous turn. It is increasingly being weaponized -- used as a way to shift responsibility for social problems from institutions to individuals. Shaming children for not being able to afford school lunches or adults for not being able to find work lets us off the hook as a society. After all, why pay higher taxes to fund programmes for people who are fundamentally unworthy? ONeil explores the machinery behind all this shame, showing how governments, corporations and the healthcare system capitalize on it. There are damning stories of rehab clinics, reentry programs, drug and diet companies, and social media platforms -- all of which profit from punching down on the vulnerable. Woven throughout The Shame Machine is the story of ONeils own struggle with body image and her recent weight-loss surgery, which awakened her to the systematic shaming of fat people seeking medical care.

Torrance pursued a theology that was realist because he attempted to think in accordance with the unique nature of the object that is known. In holding to such a methodology, he drew an analogy between theology and natural science.

It addresses the current state of knowledge about the major mental health disorders that emerge during adolescence, including updated DSM-5 diagnostic criteria. Here, six commissions established by the APPC and the Sunnylands Trust pool their expertise on adolescent anxiety, schizophrenia, substance use disorders, depression and bipolar disorders, eating disorders, and suicidal behavior in sections that thoroughly define each disorder, outline and assess available treatments, discuss prevention strategies, and suggest a research agenda based on what we know and dont yet know about these various conditions. Two additional behavioral disorders-gambling and internet addiction--are covered in this second edition. As a meaningful counterpoint to its primary focus on mental illness, the volume also incorporates the latest research from a seventh commission--on positive youth development--which addresses how we can fully prepare young people to be happy and successful throughout their lives. Concluding chapters discuss overarching issues regarding the behavioral and mental health of adolescents: overcoming the stigma of mental illness, the research, policy, and practice context for the delivery of evidence-based treatments, and the development of a more robust agenda to advance adolescent health. Integrating the work of eminent scholars in both psychology and psychiatry, this work will be an essential volume for academics and practicing clinicians and will serve as a wake-up call to mental health professionals and policy makers alike about the state of our nations response to the needs of adolescents with mental disorders.') ;

He set the standard for film biography with pictures such as Young Mr. Lincoln and The Story of Alexander Graham Bell . He innovated CinemaScope. And he molded the star images of James Cagney, Shirley Temple, Tyrone Power, Betty Grable, Marilyn Monroe, and Rin Tin Tin.In this major new biography, George F.

Selznick, how he developed the gritty realism that came to redefine motion pictures, and how he brilliantly predicted and capitalized on changing public tastes.Zanuck was a man of enormous energy and eccentricity, commanding his studio with a sawed-off polo mallet. Dozens of his memorable films—including I Am a Fugitive from a Chain Gang , The Grapes of Wrath, Gentlemans Agreement, All About Eve, The Day the Earth Stood Still , and The Robe —have come to represent the era in which they were made. Hard-boiled or nostalgic, historical or pure Hollywood, Zanucks films and Zanuck himself have become legends of the cinema. But what exactly was this producers contribution to the films he made? How did he rise from being a writer of silent serials to become head of production at Warner Brothers by his mid-twenties, and then to form his own studio, Twentieth Century-Fox at age thirty-three?Twentieth Centurys Fox tells the whole story—from Zanucks boyhood to his tumultuous years with the feuding Warners, his battles with the censors and with his own actors, and the legendary acting-out of scenes during story conferences in his famous green office. Along the way, Custen treats us to inside stories about actors such as Edward G. Robinson, Gregory Peck, and Marilyn Monroe. In never-before-published story conference notes, telegrams, and surprisingly candid anecdotes, he reveals how—more than any producer before or since—this diminutive, enigmatic fellow from Wahoo, Nebraska, changed the way we look at film.Custen highlights the studio as the context of production.

Unlike many other books on economic geology, both economic W-Sn skarns and non-economic examples are covered, in order to enable the academically-oriented reader to grasp the full range of such deposits, and also to aid the economic geologist in distinguishing between W-Sn skarns having economic potential and those which do not. W-Sn skarns are notoriously complex, containing a wide range of textures, grain sizes, mineral assemblages, bulk compositions and structures. The lack of a sufficiently detailed data base, coupled with some unsupportable genetic models, has led to many misunderstandings and has often resulted in needless expenditure and effort on fruitless mineral exploration. Thus, the first aim of this book is simply to provide an adequate data base with sufficient references to enable an interested worker to define a skarn deposit and know where to find additional information on similar examples.') ;

Ο Βλαντίμιρ Πούτιν, με ελάχιστη κυβερνητική και διοικητική εμπειρία πέρα από τη θητεία του ως αντιδημάρχου της Αγίας Πετρούπολης και ένα σύντομο διάστημα στη θέση του διευθυντή της μυστικής αστυνομίας, έμοιαζε ωστόσο η τέλεια λύση: ένα «απρόσωπο» πλάσμα που ο Γέλτσιν και οι στενοί του φίλοι πίστευαν πως μπορούσαν να διαμορφώσουν κατ’ εικόνα τους. Ξαφνικά το αγόρι που είχε μεγαλώσει στις σχολικές αυλές του μεταπολεμικού Λένινγκραντ παίζοντας ξύλο και κάνοντας όνειρα να κυβερνήσει τον κόσμο έγινε δημόσιο πρόσωπο και η δημοτικότητά του εκτοξεύτηκε στα ύψη. Η Ρωσία και μια ξελογιασμένη Δύση ήταν αποφασισμένες να βλέπουν τον προοδευτικό ηγέτη των ονείρων τους, ακόμα και όταν, με ανελέητη αποτελεσματικότητα, ο Πούτιν ξήλωνε τα μέσα ενημέρωσης της χώρας, αποσπούσε διά της βίας από την ανθούσα επιχειρηματική τάξη τον έλεγχο και τα πλούτη της και αποδεκάτιζε τους εύθραυστους μηχανισμούς της δημοκρατίας. Μέσα σε ελάχιστα χρόνια, ουσιαστικά κάθε εμπόδιο για την αχαλίνωτη κυριαρχία του απομακρύνθηκε και κάθε αντίθετη φωνή φιμώθηκε, με τους πολιτικούς αντιπάλους και τους επικριτές να οδηγούνται στην εξορία ή στον τάφο.Ως δημοσιογράφος που ζει στη Μόσχα, η Μάσα Γκέσεν βίωσε από πρώτο χέρι αυτή την ιστορία και για το βιβλίο της χρησιμοποίησε στοιχεία και πηγές που κανένας άλλος συγγραφέας δεν έχει αξιοποιήσει. Η εξιστόρηση του τρόπου με τον οποίο ένας «απρόσωπος» άνθρωπος ελίχτηκε για να φτάσει στην απόλυτη –και απόλυτα διεφθαρμένη– εξουσία διαθέτει όλα τα χαρακτηριστικά ενός κλασικού μη λογοτεχνικού πεζογραφήματος. Μια μοναδική βιογραφία, που κυκλοφορεί στα ελληνικά ταυτόχρονα με την πρωτότυπη αγγλική έκδοση. «Καθαρό και γενναίο...» James Meek, The Observer «Κάθε άνθρωπος που διαβάζει εφημερίδα θα ’πρεπε να διαβάσει το βιβλίο αυτό. Και θα το διαβάσει σαν το πιο δυνατό θρίλερ: ξέπνοος και ανήμπορος, δεν θα το αφήσει από τα χέρια του μέχρι το τελος».Berliner Zeitung «H Gessen μεταφέρει την ατμόσφαιρα καλύτερα από οποιονδήποτε».

Έτσι ξεκινά αυτός ο πολύ προσωπικός και συγκινητικός στοχασμός του Paul Auster με θέμα την πατρότητα. Στο πρώτο μέρος του βιβλίου με τίτλο «Πορτρέτο ενός αόρατου ανθρώπου», ο συγγραφέας αποκαλύπτει τις αναμνήσεις και τα συναισθήματά του μετά τον θάνατο του πατέρα του – ενός απόμακρου, ελάχιστα εκδηλωτικού, σχεδόν ψυχρού ανθρώπου. Καθώς φροντίζει για τις υποθέσεις του πατέρα του και σκαλίζει τα υπάρχοντά του, ο Auster ανακαλύπτει ένα οικογενειακό μυστικό: έναν φόνο που χρονολογείται εξήντα χρόνια πριν, ο οποίος θα φωτίσει τον απροσδιόριστο χαρακτήρα του πατέρα του. Στο δεύτερο μέρος, με τίτλο το «Βιβλίο της μνήμης», η οπτική γωνία μετατοπίζεται από την ταυτότητα του Auster ως γιου στον ρόλο του ως πατέρα. Μέσα από ένα μωσαϊκό εικόνων, συμπτώσεων και συνειρμών ο αφηγητής, ο Α., συλλογίζεται τον χωρισμό του από τον δικό του γιο, τον ετοιμοθάνατο παππού του, αλλά και τη μοναχική φύση της αφήγησης και της συγγραφής. Το τρίτο μέρος είναι μια συνέντευξη του ίδιου του συγγραφέα στην πανεπιστημιακό I. B. Siegumfeldt με θέμα την Επινόηση της μοναξιάς, περίπου τριάντα χρόνια μετά την έκδοση του βιβλίου, η οποία δημοσιεύεται για πρώτη φορά στην παρούσα έκδοση. «Η Επινόηση της μοναξιάς είναι ένα βιβλίο για έναν άνδρα μόνο σ’ ένα δωμάτιο, και συγκεκριμένα για εμένα. Αυτό που συμβαίνει όταν είσαι μόνος είναι ότι καταλαβαίνεις πως εντός σου κατοικούν κι άλλοι. Εντός σου κατοικούν κι άλλοι και εσύ υπάρχεις ως άτομο μόνο σε συσχετισμό με τους άλλους».

Generally, the bulky Gasper-Rahman notation was used, but the published works on q-calculus looked different depending on where and by whom they were written. This confusion of tongues not only complicated the theoretical development but also contributed to q-calculus remaining a neglected mathematical field. This book overcomes these problems by introducing a new and interesting notation for q-calculus based on logarithms.For instance, q-hypergeometric functions are now visually clear and easy to trace back to their hypergeometric parents. With this new notation it is also easy to see the connection between q-hypergeometric functions and the q-gamma function, something that until now has been overlooked. The book covers many topics on q-calculus, including special functions, combinatorics, and q-difference equations. Apart from a thorough review of the historical development of q-calculus, this book also presents the domains of modern physics for which q-calculus is applicable, such as particle physics and supersymmetry, to name just a few.​') ;

In this diverse set of essays, Angharad N. Valdivia breaks theoretical and methodological boundaries by exploring the relationship of the media to various audiences. Throughout A Latina in the Land of Hollywood we are challenged to think differently about the media messages we often unconsciously consume, such as the popular representations of certain Latina cultural icons. Valdivia shows how reporters focus on Guatemalan activist Rigoberta Menchús big smile, Brazilian media magnate Xuxas blonde hair, and Puerto Rican actress Rosie Perezs high-pitched voice, never quite creating a comprehensive portrayal of these women. In her discussion of lingerie catalogs, Valdivia uncovers a similarly skewed depiction. The lush, high-class bedrooms of Victorias Secret differ as much from the earthy, spare world of Fredericks of Hollywood as the types, sizes, and uses of the lingerie that the two companies sell. Valdivia takes a look at family films, arguing that single mothers are almost always portrayed as either trampy floozies or sexless, hapless women, whereas single dads fare much better. Whether examining one teenagers likes and dislikes or considering single parenthood in family films, Valdivia investigates how popular culture has become the arena in which we struggle to know ourselves and to make ourselves known. She calls for scholars to move beyond investigating implicit themes in films and media to studying the ways that audiences of different colors, ages, genders, and sexual preferences might understand or misunderstand such cultural messages.

This book articulates his reasons for abandoning the church of his ancestors for the Roman communion, reasons that centered on a deep and systematic re-thinking of the central issue of the Reformation: the Lutheran doctrine of justification by faith alone. Koons draws on a broad knowledge of the Scriptures, the Church Fathers, and the most prominent theologians of the Lutheran movement from the time of the Reformation until the present, including Luther, Melanchthon, Chemnitz, and Robert Preus. Since Jesus clearly intended for the church to remain visibly united, the burden of proof on any theological innovation is heavy, and Koons demonstrates that the Lutheran doctrine was innovative, and he argues, relying on the best New Testament scholarship, that the Bible passages cited by the Reformers do not support the innovative features of the Lutheran doctrine. Koons seeks to eliminate widespread misunderstandings of the Catholic doctrine of justification on the part of many Protestants, emphasizing the christocentric character of that teaching. Koons argues that, in contrast, the Lutheran doctrine is inconsistent. He also points out serious logical problems with the principle of sola scriptura.') ;

Officers and men of the navys four-piper destroyers began by investigating circumstances on the ground in mainland Turkey right after World War I, and by transporting American relief teams to ports throughout Turkey and Southern Russia to aid the tens of thousands of orphans and refugees who had survived the wartime Armenian genocide. Then the destroyers assisted in the final evacuation of 150,000 White Russians from the Crimea to Constantinople (one of the final acts of the Russian Revolution); coordinated the visits of the Hoover grain ships to ports in Southern Russia where millions were enduring a horrendous famine; witnessed and reported on the terrible dolorosa of the Greeks of the Pontus regious of Turkey; and, in September of 1922, conducted the evacuation of hundreds of thousands of Greek and Armenian refugees from burning Smyrna. This latter event was the cataclysmic conclusion of the Turkish Nationalist Revolutino, which had begun in early 1920. After Smyrna, the destroyers escorted Greek steamers in their rescue of ethnic Christian civilians being expelled from all the ports of Anatolian Turkey. As the conclusion of a long war between Nationalist Turks and an invading Hellenic Greek army, these people were being forced out of their ancestral homes by the Turks. Sometimes American destroyers carried hundreds of such refugees to friendly ports on their own weather decks.

This edition of Appellate Courts provides teachers with choices that are suitable for a two- or three-unit course or a seminar. The book permits emphasis on either appellate jurisdiction and practice or on the structural and policy aspects of appellate court organization and administration. All the chapters have been revamped and updated, with coverage of appellate jurisdiction substantially expanded. Using both classic and new cases, the book examines theoretical and practical issues arising from the appellate courts dual roles to correct trial court error and to generate common law. Its coverage of the dramatic rise in the volume of appeals and the resultant institutional reforms far surpasses that of any other law school course book. Fresh materials present new perspectives on appellate structures, personnel, and procedures--preparing students to practice in the contemporary state and federal appellate courts. This provocative book considers such issues as the delegation of responsibility to law clerks and staff attorneys, the threats to judicial collegiality, the selection of state and federal judges--including the regulation of judicial candidates speech, and the role and ethics of the appellate lawyer. It devotes a separate chapter to the U.S. Supreme Courts discretionary jurisdiction while another chapter draws upon Professor Meadors unique understanding of the English and German appellate systems to contrast those systems with our own. In short, this book is unique in not only exploring appellate jurisdiction and procedure but also in taking the measure of the appellate courts in all their dimensions as important institutions in the American legal order. The Teachers Manual also has been updated and greatly expanded to assist both experienced and less-experienced teachers. It includes discussion of the principal cases and secondary materials as well as expert suggestions concerning answers to questions posed in the Notes.

Bedes Temple: An Image and its Interpretation examines Bedes use of the temple to reveal his ideas of history, the universe, Christ, the Church, and the individual Christian. Across his wide body of writings Bede presented an image of unity, whether that be the unity of Jew and gentile in the universal Church, or the unity of human and divine in the incarnate Christ, and the temple-image provided a means of understanding and celebrating that unity.

Later a parallel construction using complex analysis and its associated co-homology theories grew up as a result of work by Borel, Weil, Harish-Chandra, Bott, Langlands, Kostant, and Schmid. Cohomological induction, introduced by Zuckerman, is an algebraic analog that is technically more manageable than the complex-analysis construction and leads to a large repertory of irreducible unitary representations of reductive Lie groups. The book, which is accessible to students beyond the first year of graduate school, will interest mathematicians and physicists who want to learn about and take advantage of the algebraic side of the representation theory of Lie groups. Cohomological Induction and Unitary Representations develops the necessary background in representation theory and includes an introductory chapter of motivation, a thorough treatment of the translation principle, and four appendices on algebra and analysis.') ;

Insert into Summary (`BookID`,`Summary`) Values ('1855','The psychologist who pursues an interest in personality is constantly faced by a dilemma. He seeks to investigate what is to him the most intriguing and interesting subject--the multifaceted operations of man in his natural environment. The predicament lies in the discrepancy between the complexity and richness of mans subjective experience, and the pallid analog of these experiences the psychologist is able to study effectively with the research procedures available to him. In Concepts of Personality Joseph M. Wepman and Ralph W. Heine offer a comprehensive survey of classical and contemporary personality theory, including a wide array of examples of these two trends. If the psychologist holds to the premises of strict objectivity through controlled observations, he finds himself driven to the periphery of the very problem he seeks to understand. This is a place where the reliability of measurement and the validity and predictability of his instruments can often be specified, but only at the cost of abandoning the goal of useful generality or of application to the individual in his ordinary life circumstances. Concepts of Personality, unlike most books on the subject, is not limited to broad, general theories. It includes chapters on basic processes--learning, perception, genetics, and drive theory; on the major analytical approaches of psychology and psychiatry; on anthropological and sociological contributions; and on the problems of measurement and assessment. Each chapter is by an authority on the point of view expressed. The editors introduction, itself a major essay on the complex and divergent patterns and themes of contemporary views of personality, carefully leads the reader through the information at hand. The book as a whole constitutes an encyclopedic summary of the state of the science. Joseph M. Wepman was professor of psychology and surgery and chairman of the Interdepartmental Clinical and Counseling Psychology Training Program of the University of Chicago.

OGormans book, which was first published in 1871, narrates the story of her trials and experiences during the 6 years she spent as a Sister of Charity, of her conversion to Protestantism in 1869, of her lectures on Romanism up until 1870 (when she married William Auffrey), Some of the revelations in Convent Life Unveiled are nothing short of blood-curdling. OGormans book caused quite a stir in her day, selling more than 300,000 copies and nearly costing her life (a failed assassination attempt sent a bullet through her bonnet, barely missing her head). During the 15-year lecture tour she took with her husband, it was claimed that more than 70 attempts were made on their lives. Regardless of the readers religious persuasion or belief in the veracity of Edith OGormans story, Convent Life Unveiled offers a fascinating, thought-provoking view of what life in a19th-century convent may very well have been like.') ;

Jerome Delaney, a professor of educational administration and former high school principal, answers the big questions about education policy in this powerful and practical primer for students. Informed by his experience in the public school system, Delaney takes a pragmatic and realistic approach that divides a complicated subject into manageable sub-topics. He grounds the debate at the classroom level: after all, that’s where the effects of high-level policy decisions ultimately play out. Starting from the basics and progressing through to the deeper aspects of education policy, this text provides an excellent introduction to a subject that lies at the foundation of every education system. This second edition includes a new chapter on issues relating to policy implementation, as well as new discussion questions at the end of each chapter. Topics include: A beginner’s overview of education policy studies. How values influence policy-making. How education policy is developed, implemented, and evaluated. The role of policy in education reform. The future of education policy as schools adapt to changing societies.') ;

While reading this book it is fun and easy to read it. This book is best suitable for first time C++ readers, Covers all fast track topics of C++ for all Computer Science students and Professionals. This book introduces standard C++ and the key programming and design techniques supported by C++. Standard C++ is a far more powerful and polished language than the version of C++ introduced by the first edition of this book. This book presents every major C++ language feature and the standard library. It is organized around language and library facilities. However, features are presented in the context of their use. That is, the focus is on the language as the tool for design and programming rather than on the language in itself. This book demonstrates key techniques that make C++ effective and teaches the fundamental concepts necessary for mastery. As everyone knows that Author Harry is basically known for his Easy way- Programming without fear technique.

Insert into Summary (`BookID`,`Summary`) Values ('1933','World War II saw the development of the heavy bomber as a decisive weapon which, in sufficient numbers, could overcome defensive fighters and guns and lay waste to strategic targets. The addition of nuclear weapons to the bombers armament made it even more formidable, and by the late 1940s, US planners saw the growth of a Soviet nuclear-armed bomber fleet as a terrifying threat to North American security. Conventional subsonic fighters with guns and free-flight air-to-air rockets would be incapable of reaching these incoming bombers in time to prevent even one from delivering a devastating nuclear attack. As a result, supersonic speed, long-range guided missiles and precise radar-based control of an interception became prerequisites for a new breed of fighters, beginning with the F-102. A massive research and development effort produced the F-102A 1954 Fighter, the J57 afterburning turbojet, its Hughes MX-1554 fire control system and, in due course, the Semi-Active Ground Environment (SAGE) radar and communications network that covered North America to guide its airborne defences. In service, F-102As also provided air defence in Europe with USAFE, in the Far East and in Southeast Asia, where they protected US airbases in South Vietnam and Thailand from air attack by North Vietnamese fighters and bombers and escorted B-52s and fighter-bombers on their attack sorties. This illustrated study from leading expert Peter E. Davis details the design, development, and deployment of the futuristic F-102, including its complex research program and role in Vietnam.') ;

It was an opportunity for Anglicans who regarded themselves as loyal to Rome, despite the interruption of the Reformation, to promote Catholic theology in the Church of England. A high doctrine of the Church and the sacraments, ritualistic worship and the revival of religious life - plus remarkable social work in slum areas - all characterise what we now call Anglo-Catholicism, still alive and well and accounting for a third of the C of E today. Here the writings of the leading lights of the Oxford Movement are introduced with a useful commentary and explanation.') ;

Most likely you will not find this information anywhere on this book section on any other book store. I have paid thousands of dollars on exclusive groups and paid forums to collect the information presented in this book. As you can imagine these are the highly guarded secrets of the elite of the FOREX traders, no one gives their living away, unless you pay them a price worth their living. However I have decided to make this information for ridiculously low price, because I am fed up with the brokers and the big banks taking advantage of the regular retail trader. Let me ask you a question? When was the last time you make money with FOREX? Even further more how much money you are willing to lose, until you give up? How long you will continue to give your hard earned money to the broker? Just like you I started 5 years ago with high hopes of quitting my job and leaving the live I deserve with FOREX. My hopes and aspirations were quickly crashed and my dreams went to the dump. First I lost 1000, then 5000, 10k , how much longer I could continue like that, how much longer I could endure the ridicule the jokes of my family and the frown on the face of my wife. It was painful, sitting all day in front of the computer, until you cant see any longer and everything including the platform and your mind become blurry. I know the pain I have been there. This continued for year, until one morning I was ready to quit, I was going to give it a last try and throw that FOREX staff in the garbage, out the window. I stumbled on a rear tread, which since then has been banned, by the broker that was holding the forum. Luckily the tread continued under the brokers radar for while, and gathered a bunch of comments an support. Finally the tread from the trader X was discontinued. I was in dis pare, that was the only hope and light, I have seen for a long time. I was applying the advice from the trade and things were starting to work for me. Fortunately I was able to PM the trader and begged him to agree on a 20 min conversation on the phone. Trader X was not a guru, not your regular internet promoter mojo. He was quietly raking in thousands of dollars a month for years, he was not excited about the next trade, his heart beat was not raising before he pooled the trigger. See, he has been doing this trading staff for so long it has become a boring procedure, rather a morning an afternoon chore, something like putting the garbage out on garbage day. He explained that he learned from the MASTER, I did not proceed to ask him who was the MASTER, since I mainly was concerned with him teaching him every little bit of what he knew about trading. He didnt not agree to spend time teaching me on our first conversation, regardless of how much I offered to pay him. See, for him money was not a issue. Finally on my third approach he agreed to show me what the MASTER had thought him many years ago. What is comprised in the pages of this book will be worth pure gold to you.This book is down to the ground no no sense, real trading knowledge. It gives step by step instructions with real trade examples. This book is not your regular hog wash advice that you will find from your broker and the other magic bullets and seven step series that you see on this site. This book teaches you how to trade like the pros. Shows you how the big banks and foreign nationals and institution trade. The book opens your eyes to how to piggy back on the big institutional traders and win. Ninety Five percent of the people that trade the Forex market lose money and give up. The market is continually replaced by fresh blood like yourself. Dont become part of the statistics, read this book and get a map to success in FOREX. You can make a success in FOREX if you know what you are doing. Yes you can make a living with FOREX and quit your job. You can achieve your dreams. Buy this book and find out How?') ;

What if you can master the game Forex trading, and trade from any place in the world where internet is available? What if all your dreams of leaving the dreaded... J.O.B. become reality...being able to give your family and loved ones the lifestyle they deserve. See, Forex is not for everyone, but is it a legitimate way out of the 9 to 5 rat race. See, as I am writing this introduction for you I am sitting under the bimini of my 51 foot sail boat yacht, in the heart of the Caribbean. Water is crystal turquoise blue, you can see all the way to the bottom.. The colors are incredible. It gives you such of sense of freedom and ability to enjoy life to the fullest. Man paradise, no alarm clocks, no traffic, I can hear the music from the small marina bar. I am not even at the marina, the boat is anchored at a mooring ball. Ha... tell me about the life, that you can have...yeah you can have it too. You need to be sick enough of your same all, same all in order to take action. Do you want trade like the pros, then you have to learn from the pros. You will not find the information in this book anywhere on the Amazon traders section. In a matter of fact no one is teaching what I am about to show you in this book. You would ask, what is so special about it. See, the people that are making a living from Forex are not about to reveal their secrets. The ones that are making money from your trades A . K. A. your friendly broker dont care . In a matter of fact they will gladly offer their friendly education, to teach you how you can too loose a large amount of money like your fellow retail traders that are using the same broker. I am revealing the highly guarded secrets of the big guns. It is possible that I get some ugly letters from traders, and even some of my friends, after this book is released. But heck yeah, I am sick and tired of seeing the daily casualty of honest and hard working people, like yourself loose their hard earned money to the broker. Enough is enough, I have made my stake is time to give back and help others to go the same road. So enough of my blurb... I have laid my hard learned secrets in that book and the price is ridiculously low. You would normally pay 2-3 times more in your local book store, for a book full of BS explaining you, the current economic climate, and how we are coming out of the recession hog wash. Year it says learn how to trade or something of that effect, but doesnt have even one tenth of the hard core to the bone content I am offering you. See I know you can live and have anything you want in this life. You can even create your own reality. Yeah I know creating you reality is cool, but it requires a dirty word called work. Do you you want to create your new reality, even step in to it. You would if you knew what is on the other side. Well I decided to create you reality for you. I have done all the dirty work and have set everything up for you for success in this book. So, punch a few buttons and take a click of faith and by this book. I promise you, you will not be disappointed. See you on the other side.') ;

Insert into Summary (`BookID`,`Summary`) Values ('1955','Designed to serve as a basic text for introductory courses in public administration, this pioneering work provides students with a clear-eyed understanding of the vital management functions covered in most standard textbooks with two important differences. First, it is written to address the needs of both the experienced practitioner and the entry-level public servant. Case examples bridge the content-rich environment of practitioners with the principles of public administration sought by pre-service students. Second, the discussion of management practices is grounded in the political and ethical tensions inherent in the American constitutional form of governance. This innovative approach reflects the authors belief that public administration operates as an integral part of the countrys political traditions, and thereby helps define the political culture. Key themes in this third edition include: - An emphasis on the ways in which public administration and their agents play a critical role in ensuring legal and political accountability of the political system. - An exploration of local public administration as the backstop of American democracy, requiring a close working partnership between part-time elected officials and career administrators. - Careful examination of the ways in which American political economy requires administrators who are skilled at co-producing the common good with voluntary associations, businesses, nonprofit organizations and other governmental entities. - An understanding that public administration plays a critical role with its prudential judgments in balancing the competing values necessary to secure a regime of ordered liberty. Every chapter has been thoroughly updated, with particular attention paid to chapters on budgeting and revenue, e-government and the digital divide, shared power and the rise of wicked problems,  and the future of public administration in the United States amidst deep polarization. Foundations of Public Service, 3rd Edition provides a framework for understanding American political traditions and how they inform public administration as a political practice. It is required reading for all introductory Public Administration courses with an emphasis on practice and real-world applications.') ;

Second, the discussion of management practices is grounded in the political and ethical tensions inherent in the American constitutional form of governance. This innovative approach reflects the authors belief that public administration operates as an integral part of the countrys political traditions, and thereby helps define the political culture. Key themes in this third edition include: - An emphasis on the ways in which public administration and their agents play a critical role in ensuring legal and political accountability of the political system. - An exploration of local public administration as the backstop of American democracy, requiring a close working partnership between part-time elected officials and career administrators. - Careful examination of the ways in which American political economy requires administrators who are skilled at co-producing the common good with voluntary associations, businesses, nonprofit organizations and other governmental entities. - An understanding that public administration plays a critical role with its prudential judgments in balancing the competing values necessary to secure a regime of ordered liberty. Every chapter has been thoroughly updated, with particular attention paid to chapters on budgeting and revenue, e-government and the digital divide, shared power and the rise of wicked problems,  and the future of public administration in the United States amidst deep polarization. Foundations of Public Service, 3rd Edition provides a framework for understanding American political traditions and how they inform public administration as a political practice.

The core of the book then focusses on the presentation and practical implementations of modelling techniques used for fingerprinting processes such as partial melting, fractional crystallization, binary mixing or AFC using major-, trace-element and radiogenic isotope data. The reader will be given a firm theoretical basis for forward/reverse modelling, followed by exercises dealing with typical problems likely to be encountered in real life, and their solutions using R. The concluding sections demonstrate, using practical examples, how a researcher can proceed in developing a realistic model simulating natural systems.

Those familiar with her work know that her powerful ethical vision was rooted in a quiet, devout faith and informed all she wrote and did. Good Things Out of Nazareth, a much-anticipated collection of many of O’Connor’s previously unpublished letters—along with those of literary luminaries such as Walker Percy (The Moviegoer), Caroline Gordon (None Shall Look Back), Katherine Anne Porter (Ship of Fools), Robert Giroux and movie critic Stanley Kauffmann. The letters explore such themes as creativity, faith, suffering, and writing. Brought together, they form a riveting literary portrait of these friends, artists, and thinkers.

Ambient temperature was increased from 28 to 43C and maintained at this level for 1.5-2.0 hours. Increases in cardiac output were small, variable (ranging from 0.3 to 1.8 liters/min.), and were caused by small increases both in heart rate and stroke volume. The greater cardiac output was temporally related more closely to the augmented stroke volume which was, in turn, closely related to cutaneous vadodilatation as demonstrated by the cutaneous opacity pulses, the implication being that the augmented stroke volume probably results from the greater cutaneous venous return. The ratio of increase in cardiac output to sweating was about the same as previously shown; changes in oral temperature were small in all subjects, averaging about 0.5F. Validation of the electrical impedance technic as a measure of right ventricular stroke output was accomplished in dogs through comparisons of pulmonary arterial blood flow (electromagnetic flowmeter) and dye dilution (cardiogreen) cardiac output with that obtained by the impedance method.

In this book, Christopher W. Hughes assesses developments in defence expenditure, civilmilitary relations, domestic and international militaryindustrial complexes, Japans procurement of regional and global power-projection capabilities, the expansion of USJapan cooperation, and attitudes towards nuclear weapons, constitutional revision and the use of military force. In all of these areas, dynamic and long-term changes outweigh Japans short-term political logjam over security policy. Hughes argues that many post-war constraints on Japans military role are still eroding, and that Tokyo is moving towards a more assertive military role and strengthened USJapan cooperation. Japans remilitarisation will boost its international security role and the dominance of the USJapan alliance in regional and global security affairs, but will need to be carefully managed if it is not to become a source of destabilising tensions.') ;

Insert into Summary (`BookID`,`Summary`) Values ('2048','Until 1860 John Ruskins writings were primarily about art and architecture; but his belief that good art can flourish only in a society that is sound and healthy led him inevitably to a preoccupation with social and economic problems, the dominant concern of his later writings. James Clark Sherburne provides in this volume a detailed and long overdue re-examination of Ruskins social and economic perceptions and, for the first time, systematically places these perceptions in their nineteenth-century intellectual context. Ruskins eloquence and the strength of his moral, aesthetic, and social convictions established him as one of the most influential of Victorian writers. His writings, however, are not easily categorized and many of his important insights occur as digressions in discussions of other topics. Mr. Sherburne succeeds in ordering and clarifying the rich chaos of Ruskins social thought without denying that wholeness which is, paradoxically, its salient feature. He discovers the source of Ruskins social criticism in his early writings. He then follows Ruskins interest as it shifts from economic theory to the problems of exploitation, war, imperialism, the means of social reform, and the construction of the welfare state. Ruskins remarkably early vision of the possibility of economic abundance, his anticipation of its social and personal implications, his much disparaged critique of classical economics, his pioneering attention to the role of the consumer and the quality of consumption, his anxious portrayal of the effects of industrialism on the environment, his critique of English educational methods, and his farsighted proposals for public management of industry and transport are among the many aspects of Ruskins thought examined by Mr. Sherburne. What emerges is an original and exhaustive study of a dimension of Ruskins work which, though much neglected, is particularly relevant to contemporary concerns.') ;

Insert into Summary (`BookID`,`Summary`) Values ('2056','K-Wiring: Principles and Techniques Kirschner wires or K-wires are sterilized, sharpened, smooth stainless steel pins/wires used in orthopedic surgery as implants. K-wire implants are extremely versatile in their usage and can treat fractures of various kinds in most of the bones from finger tips to toes. Due to their remarkable ability to heal and reconstruct intricate bone fractures, they are a popular choice among orthopedic surgeons the world over. Each reconstruction is an innovation in itself, as every complex fracture presents its unique challenges. There is a paucity of literature on standard techniques, principles and approaches to be employed for K-wiring fractures. This book fills that gap. It is the first of its kind in demonstrating the effective execution of K-wiring procedures through a lucid, case-based format. It serves as a practical guide for orthopedic surgeons on K-wiring techniques, thus enabling them to improve patient care.

Given the trend towards regionalization of economic ties across the world, especially after the successful launch of the euro, a detailed analysis of the WAMZ is needed. As this is the first book on monetary and financial integration in Gambia, Ghana, Guinea, Nigeria and Sierra Leone, it is an essential read for anyone interested in economic development in West Africa, and indeed in Africa as a whole. This book is extremely well-researched, with detail on virtually all aspects of economic integration in the region; with issues ranging from the institutional details of integration, trade and financial market integration, to progress on convergence of macroeconomic fundamentals to the required payments system infrastructure. The book deploys solid empirical facts and sophisticated analyses to thoroughly defend its assertions. This collection is a valuable contribution and an excellent companion book for monetary economics or international economics classes as well as African development literature. It will provide students and researchers with an exciting chance to apply concepts of, for example, optimum currency areas, central bank structure or monetary policy approaches, to a real-world case of potential monetary union. Dr. Temitope W. Oshikoya and his collaborators have written the authoritative book on the subject of monetary union in the West African Monetary Zone. As is evident in the level of detail of the book, Dr. Oshikoya brings rich field experience from his role as Director General and CEO of the West African Monetary Institute. This book will be of interest to postgraduates and researchers in development economics; as well as policymakers, monetary authorities and development practitioners.') ;

Having a Baby, Naturally reflects this spirit with straightforward, uncensored information about pregnancy and childbirth, addressing common concerns and questions in a compassionate, nonjudgmental style. Written by Peggy OMara, the longtime publisher, editor, and owner of Mothering magazine, it synthesizes the best theories and safest practices used in natural childbirth, including recommendations from the World Health Organization, the American Academy of Pediatrics, and the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists.

She covers such topics as: Nutrition, diet, and exercise Emotional self-awareness during and after pregnancy A trimester-by-trimester guide to what is happening in your body and your childs Birth choices -- offering suggestions, not rules Pain medication alternatives Birth locations, from hospitals to home birth Relieving morning sickness with natural remedies Prenatal testing Breastfeeding Prematurity and multiple births Balancing work and family The fathers role during pregnancy and beyond Difficult subjects, such as birth defects, miscarriages, and postpartum depression, are also treated with sensitivity and candor.

In Movies, Songs, and Electric Sound, Charles O’Brien examines American and European musical films created circa 1930, when the world’s sound-equipped theaters screened movies featuring recorded songs and filmmakers in the United States and Europe struggled to meet the artistic and technical challenges of sound production and distribution. The presence of singers in films exerted special pressures on film technique, lending a distinct look and sound to the films’ musical sequences. Rather than advancing a film’s plot, songs in these films were staged, filmed, and cut to facilitate the singer’s engagement with her or his public. Through an examination of the export market for sound films in the early 1930s, when German and American companies used musical films as a vehicle for competing to control the world film trade, this book delineates a new transnational context for understanding the Hollywood musical. Combining archival research with the cinemetric analysis of hundreds of American, German, French, and British films made between 1927 and 1934, O’Brien provides the historical context necessary for making sense of the aesthetic impact of changes in film technology from the past to the present.') ;

In 1958 Shirshov was awarded the Doctor of Science degree for the thesis “On some classes of rings that are nearly associative”. In 1960 Shirshov moved to Novosibirsk (at the invitations of S. L. Sobolev and A. I. Malcev) to become one of the founders of the new mathematical institute of the Academy of Sciences (now Sobolev Institute of Mathematics) and to help the formation of the new Novosibirsk State University.

The model predicts that information sharing of signals within social groups can facilitate information aggregation when the social groups are sufficiently large even when it is not predicted with individual signals. We use experiments in the laboratory and on Amazon Mechanical Turk to test these predictions. We find that information sharing in social groups significantly affects citizens protest decisions and as a consequence mitigates the effects of high conflict, leading to greater efficiency in policy makers choices. Our experiments highlight that social media can play an important role in protests beyond simply a way in which citizens can coordinate their actions; and indeed that the information aggregation and the coordination motives behind public protests are intimately connected and cannot be conceptually separated.') ;

The effect of training was studied by using a test-train-retest-delay-retest procedure. Performance was measured in terms of absolute error, in degrees, between the estimated direction and the correct direction. Analyses showed that average error in direction estimation using tactical maps was reduced significantly by training, dropping from a mean of 6.1 degrees before training to 4.8 degrees after training. There were also significant differences in accuracy of direction estimates as a function of map scale, distance between reference points, and compass octant in which the reference points were located.

Whether it was an American ’plane operating from American escort carriers, US aircraft from Royal Air Force bases, or British aircraft from bases throughout the world, these officers and men became the most decisive factor in turning the tide of the Battle of the Atlantic against the German submarine threat. While the German crews could threaten escort vessels with torpedoes, or avoid them by remaining submerged, their leaders never developed an effective strategy against aircraft. However, the Allied aircraft did not enjoy much early success. British, Canadian and Australian air crews that fought the U-boats from 1939 until 1941 achieved few triumphs. They possessed neither the aircraft nor the bases necessary to deliver consistent lethal attacks against German submarines. In 1941, the Royal Air Force finally began implementing an effective aircraft response when it initiated training on the American-built Consolidated B-24 Liberators. Supported by other types then in service, these four-engine bombers would prove to be decisive. With America’s entry into the war, the United States Navy and the United States Army Air Forces also began employing Liberators against the U-boats so that by mid-1943, the Admiral Karl Dönitz, commander of U-boat forces, withdrew his submarines from the North Atlantic in recognition of the Allied aircraft’s new dominance. From Dönitz’s retreat to the end of the war, Allied aircraft continued to dominate the U-boat battle as it shifted to other areas including the Bay of Biscay. Dönitz eventually ordered his U-boats to remain on the surface and engage Allied aircraft as opposed to submerging. This approach did lead to the demise of some Allied aircraft, but it also resulted in even more U-boat being sunk. Most critically, Dönitz acknowledged with his new policy that he knew of no tactics or weapons that would defend his submarines from Allied aircraft. In the end, it was a matter of choosing whether his submariners would die submerged or die surfaced. Either way, Allied aircraft prevailed. The Allied Air Campaign Against Hitler’s U-Boats is the most comprehensive study ever undertaken of this most crucial battle which helped turn the Battle of the Atlantic irrevocably in favour of the Allies.') ;

This unique discography provides for the first time in print a systematic numerical listing and cross-referencing of all released recordings in the 5000 and 17000 Cajun series as well as records released under Deccas Champion 45000 and Montgomery Ward series, also devoted to hillbilly music. A total of 1514 discs are covered ranging from records released by such major hillbilly music stars as Jimmie Davis, the Sons of the Pioneers, and Ernest Tubb to those by less well-known solo artists and groups, including the Corn Cob Crushers and the Happy Hollow Hoodlums. Based on painstaking research in the original session books, ledgers, and label copy books as well as interviews with musicians and singers who participated in Decca recording sessions, this discography of one of the most remarkable record series of the 20th century makes a major contribution to the study of contemporary American music. The volume begins with an introduction which traces the early history of the Decca Record Company and its impact on hillbilly music of the 1930s and 1940s. Cary Ginell demonstrates that the Decca 5000 and other hillbilly series had a major role not only in documenting the history of hillbilly music but also in affecting its course by influencing future recording artists in the genre. Following a brief section which describes how to use the discography and the indexes, the discography itself is divided into four separate numerical listings: Decca 5000, Decca 17000, Decca/Champion 45000, and Montgomery Ward recordings. Each listing includes information about recording dates, master numbers, unissued titles, song titles and legends, songwriter credits, and release dates. Five indexes--artist, matrix and location, release dates, composer credits, and title--provide enhanced access to the main listings. Scholars and researchers of American country and folk music, both once included under the hillbilly banner--will find this discography an indispensable resource.') ;

As you can imagine these are the highly guarded secrets of the elite of the FOREX traders, no one gives their living away, unless you pay them a price worth their living. However I have decided to make this information for ridiculously low price, because I am fed up with the brokers and the big banks taking advantage of the regular retail trader. Let me ask you a question? When was the last time you make money with FOREX? Even further more how much money you are willing to lose, until you give up? How long you will continue to give your hard earned money to the broker? Just like you I started 5 years ago with high hopes of quitting my job and leaving the live I deserve with FOREX. My hopes and aspirations were quickly crashed and my dreams went to the dump. First I lost 1000, then 5000, 10k , how much longer I could continue like that, how much longer I could endure the ridicule the jokes of my family and the frown on the face of my wife. It was painful, sitting all day in front of the computer, until you cant see any longer and everything including the platform and your mind become blurry. I know the pain I have been there. This continued for year, until one morning I was ready to quit, I was going to give it a last try and throw that FOREX staff in the garbage, out the window. I stumbled on a rear tread, which since then has been banned, by the broker that was holding the forum. Luckily the tread continued under the brokers radar for while, and gathered a bunch of comments an support. Finally the tread from the trader X was discontinued. I was in dis pare, that was the only hope and light, I have seen for a long time. I was applying the advice from the trade and things were starting to work for me. Fortunately I was able to PM the trader and begged him to agree on a 20 min conversation on the phone. Trader X was not a guru, not your regular internet promoter mojo. He was quietly raking in thousands of dollars a month for years, he was not excited about the next trade, his heart beat was not raising before he pooled the trigger. See, he has been doing this trading staff for so long it has become a boring procedure, rather a morning an afternoon chore, something like putting the garbage out on garbage day. He explained that he learned from the MASTER, I did not proceed to ask him who was the MASTER, since I mainly was concerned with him teaching him every little bit of what he knew about trading. He didnt not agree to spend time teaching me on our first conversation, regardless of how much I offered to pay him. See, for him money was not a issue. Finally on my third approach he agreed to show me what the MASTER had thought him many years ago. What is comprised in the pages of this book will be worth pure gold to you.This book is down to the ground no no sense, real trading knowledge.

Insert into Summary (`BookID`,`Summary`) Values ('2348','Messianism is one of the great themes in intellectual history. But because it has done so much important ideological work for the people who have written about it, the historical roots of the discourse have been obscured from view. What did it mean to talk about messiahs in the ancient world, before the idea of messianism became a philosophical juggernaut, dictating the terms for all subsequent discussion of the topic? In this book, Matthew V. Novenson offers a revisionist account of messianism in antiquity. He shows that, for the ancient Jews and Christians who used the term, a messiah was not an article of faith but a manner of speaking. It was a scriptural figure of speech, one among numerous others, useful for thinking about kinds of political order: present or future, real or ideal, monarchic or theocratic, dynastic or charismatic, and other variations besides. The early Christians famously seized upon the title messiah (in Greek, Christ) for their founding hero and molded the sense of the term in certain ways; but, Novenson shows, this is just what all ancient messiah texts do, each in its own way. If we hope to understand the ancient texts about messiahs (from Deutero-Isaiah to the Parables of Enoch, from the Qumran Community Rule to the Gospel of John, from the Pseudo-Clementines to Sefer Zerubbabel), we must learn to think not in terms of a world-historical idea but of a language game, of so many creative reuses of an archaic Israelite idiom. In The Grammar of Messianism, Novenson demonstrates the possibility and the benefit of thinking of messianism in this way.') ;

This book invites the readers on a journey through the eye and mind of the architect, from the very drawings that give shape and form to the idea, through the tracks and traces found in long lost letters, office records, and other primary sources.

In The Mediterranean World, Monique O’Connell and Eric R Dursteler examine the history of this contested region from the medieval to the early modern era, beginning with the fall of Rome around 500 CE and closing with Napoleon’s attempted conquest of Egypt in 1798. Arguing convincingly that the Mediterranean should be studied as a singular unit, the authors explore the centuries when no lone power dominated the Mediterranean Sea and invaders brought their own unique languages and cultures to the region.

I knew I had the beginning of a great thing, a great truth in architecture. -Frank Lloyd Wright Early on the morning of June 4, 1905, lightning struck the steeple of Unity Church in the Chicago suburb of Oak Park, igniting a fire that would raze the building to the ground. The Unitarian congregation suddenly needed a home and turned to local architect Frank Lloyd Wright for a new approach. Thus begins the story of a watershed moment in the career of the worlds most influential architect and in the history of twentieth-century architecture and design. Wrights design for Unity Temple was radical in its simplicity-a monolithic concrete exterior-yet sublime in its detail and revolutionary in its use of interior space. With Wrights execution of Unity Temple, the ideas hed been working on and experimenting with for years were finally brought to fruition, and modern design was born. But it might never have happened if not for a devoted Unitarian congregation who embraced Wrights ideas and remained faithful to the architect and his vision through the trials and calamities of construction. Unity Temple, when completed in 1909, was-and still is-considered one of the landmarks of modern architecture. Author David M. Sokol poured more than 20 years of research into The Noble Room and uncovers a dramatic tale-much of which turns out to be at odds with the accepted story of how Wright himself described the process. Anyone with an interest in architecture or in Frank Lloyd Wright-or indeed anyone whos ever had an addition put on to their house or a kitchen remodeled-will be caught up in the story of the tumultuous, chaotic creation of a modern masterpiece, which comes to life in The Noble Room.') ;

Its time to fight back Shame is a powerful and sometimes useful tool. When we publicly shame corrupt politicians, abusive celebrities, or predatory corporations, we reinforce values of fairness and justice. But as best-selling author Cathy ONeil argues in this revelatory book, shaming has taken a new and dangerous turn. It is increasingly being weaponized -- used as a way to shift responsibility for social problems from institutions to individuals. Shaming children for not being able to afford school lunches or adults for not being able to find work lets us off the hook as a society. After all, why pay higher taxes to fund programmes for people who are fundamentally unworthy? ONeil explores the machinery behind all this shame, showing how governments, corporations and the healthcare system capitalize on it. There are damning stories of rehab clinics, reentry programs, drug and diet companies, and social media platforms -- all of which profit from punching down on the vulnerable. Woven throughout The Shame Machine is the story of ONeils own struggle with body image and her recent weight-loss surgery, which awakened her to the systematic shaming of fat people seeking medical care. With clarity and nuance, ONeil dissects the relationship between shame and power. Whom does the system serve? How do current incentive structures perpetuate the shaming cycle? And, most important, how can we all fight back?') ;

With The Jazz Singer he supervised the innovation of film sound. With The Public Enemy and Little Caesar he reinvented the gangster film. With 42nd Street he reinvigorated the musical. He set the standard for film biography with pictures such as Young Mr. Lincoln and The Story of Alexander Graham Bell . He innovated CinemaScope. And he molded the star images of James Cagney, Shirley Temple, Tyrone Power, Betty Grable, Marilyn Monroe, and Rin Tin Tin.In this major new biography, George F. Custen illuminates Zanucks evolution into one of the most influential producers in American film. He explains what set him apart from rivals Irving Thalberg and David O. Selznick, how he developed the gritty realism that came to redefine motion pictures, and how he brilliantly predicted and capitalized on changing public tastes.Zanuck was a man of enormous energy and eccentricity, commanding his studio with a sawed-off polo mallet. Dozens of his memorable films—including I Am a Fugitive from a Chain Gang , The Grapes of Wrath, Gentlemans Agreement, All About Eve, The Day the Earth Stood Still , and The Robe —have come to represent the era in which they were made. Hard-boiled or nostalgic, historical or pure Hollywood, Zanucks films and Zanuck himself have become legends of the cinema. But what exactly was this producers contribution to the films he made? How did he rise from being a writer of silent serials to become head of production at Warner Brothers by his mid-twenties, and then to form his own studio, Twentieth Century-Fox at age thirty-three?Twentieth Centurys Fox tells the whole story—from Zanucks boyhood to his tumultuous years with the feuding Warners, his battles with the censors and with his own actors, and the legendary acting-out of scenes during story conferences in his famous green office. Along the way, Custen treats us to inside stories about actors such as Edward G. Robinson, Gregory Peck, and Marilyn Monroe. In never-before-published story conference notes, telegrams, and surprisingly candid anecdotes, he reveals how—more than any producer before or since—this diminutive, enigmatic fellow from Wahoo, Nebraska, changed the way we look at film.Custen highlights the studio as the context of production. Zanucks ability to shape the producers role and the organizational style during the golden years of the studio system—with its own peculiar methods, clearly delineated rules, and pecking order—was the crucible out of which he forged a unique vision of American film and American culture.') ;

In today’s economy, we have far too much dismay along with our amazement, and technology bears some of the blame. In this combination of memoir, business strategy guide, and call to action, Tim OReilly, Silicon Valley’s leading intellectual and the founder of O’Reilly Media, explores the upside and the potential downsides of todays WTF? technologies. What is the future when an increasing number of jobs can be performed by intelligent machines instead of people, or done only by people in partnership with those machines? What happens to our consumer based societies—to workers and to the companies that depend on their purchasing power? Is income inequality and unemployment an inevitable consequence of technological advancement, or are there paths to a better future? What will happen to business when technology-enabled networks and marketplaces are better at deploying talent than traditional companies? How should companies organize themselves to take advantage of these new tools? What’s the future of education when on-demand learning outperforms traditional institutions? How can individuals continue to adapt and retrain? Will the fundamental social safety nets of the developed world survive the transition, and if not, what will replace them? OReilly is the man who can really can make a whole industry happen, according to Eric Schmidt, Executive Chairman of Alphabet (Google.) His genius over the past four decades has been to identify and to help shape our response to emerging technologies with world shaking potential—the World Wide Web, Open Source Software, Web 2.0, Open Government data, the Maker Movement, Big Data, and now AI. O’Reilly shares the techniques hes used at O’Reilly Media to make sense of and predict past innovation waves and applies those same techniques to provide a framework for thinking about how today’s world-spanning platforms and networks, on-demand services, and artificial intelligence are changing the nature of business, education, government, financial markets, and the economy as a whole. He provides tools for understanding how all the parts of modern digital businesses work together to create marketplace advantage and customer value, and why ultimately, they cannot succeed unless their ecosystem succeeds along with them. The core of the books call to action is an exhortation to businesses to DO MORE with technology rather than just using it to cut costs and enrich their shareholders. Robots are going to take our jobs, they say. OReilly replies, “Only if that’s what we ask them to do! Technology is the solution to human problems, and we won’t run out of work till we run out of problems. Entrepreneurs need to set their sights on how they can use big data, sensors, and AI to create amazing human experiences and the economy of the future, making us all richer in the same way the tools of the first industrial revolution did. Yes, technology can eliminate labor and make things cheaper, but at its best, we use it to do things that were previously unimaginable! What is our poverty of imagination? What are the entrepreneurial leaps that will allow us to use the technology of today to build a better future, not just a more efficient one? Whether technology brings the WTF? of wonder or the WTF? of dismay isnt inevitable. Its up to us!') ;

Hirschman, one of the twentieth centurys most original and provocative thinkers. In this gripping biography, Jeremy Adelman tells the story of a man shaped by modern horrors and hopes, a worldly intellectual who fought for and wrote in defense of the values of tolerance and change. Born in Berlin in 1915, Hirschman grew up amid the promise and turmoil of the Weimar era, but fled Germany when the Nazis seized power in 1933. Amid hardship and personal tragedy, he volunteered to fight against the fascists in Spain and helped many of Europes leading artists and intellectuals escape to America after France fell to Hitler. His intellectual career led him to Paris, London, and Trieste, and to academic appointments at Columbia, Harvard, and the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton. He was an influential adviser to governments in the United States, Latin America, and Europe, as well as major foundations and the World Bank. Along the way, he wrote some of the most innovative and important books in economics, the social sciences, and the history of ideas. Throughout, he remained committed to his belief that reform is possible, even in the darkest of times. This is the first major account of Hirschmans remarkable life, and a tale of the twentieth century as seen through the story of an astute and passionate observer. Adelmans riveting narrative traces how Hirschmans personal experiences shaped his unique intellectual perspective, and how his enduring legacy is one of hope, open-mindedness, and practical idealism--') ;

Έτσι ξεκινά αυτός ο πολύ προσωπικός και συγκινητικός στοχασμός του Paul Auster με θέμα την πατρότητα. Στο πρώτο μέρος του βιβλίου με τίτλο «Πορτρέτο ενός αόρατου ανθρώπου», ο συγγραφέας αποκαλύπτει τις αναμνήσεις και τα συναισθήματά του μετά τον θάνατο του πατέρα του – ενός απόμακρου, ελάχιστα εκδηλωτικού, σχεδόν ψυχρού ανθρώπου. Καθώς φροντίζει για τις υποθέσεις του πατέρα του και σκαλίζει τα υπάρχοντά του, ο Auster ανακαλύπτει ένα οικογενειακό μυστικό: έναν φόνο που χρονολογείται εξήντα χρόνια πριν, ο οποίος θα φωτίσει τον απροσδιόριστο χαρακτήρα του πατέρα του. Στο δεύτερο μέρος, με τίτλο το «Βιβλίο της μνήμης», η οπτική γωνία μετατοπίζεται από την ταυτότητα του Auster ως γιου στον ρόλο του ως πατέρα. Μέσα από ένα μωσαϊκό εικόνων, συμπτώσεων και συνειρμών ο αφηγητής, ο Α., συλλογίζεται τον χωρισμό του από τον δικό του γιο, τον ετοιμοθάνατο παππού του, αλλά και τη μοναχική φύση της αφήγησης και της συγγραφής. Το τρίτο μέρος είναι μια συνέντευξη του ίδιου του συγγραφέα στην πανεπιστημιακό I. B. Siegumfeldt με θέμα την Επινόηση της μοναξιάς, περίπου τριάντα χρόνια μετά την έκδοση του βιβλίου, η οποία δημοσιεύεται για πρώτη φορά στην παρούσα έκδοση. «Η Επινόηση της μοναξιάς είναι ένα βιβλίο για έναν άνδρα μόνο σ’ ένα δωμάτιο, και συγκεκριμένα για εμένα. Αυτό που συμβαίνει όταν είσαι μόνος είναι ότι καταλαβαίνεις πως εντός σου κατοικούν κι άλλοι. Εντός σου κατοικούν κι άλλοι και εσύ υπάρχεις ως άτομο μόνο σε συσχετισμό με τους άλλους».

Generally, the bulky Gasper-Rahman notation was used, but the published works on q-calculus looked different depending on where and by whom they were written. This confusion of tongues not only complicated the theoretical development but also contributed to q-calculus remaining a neglected mathematical field. This book overcomes these problems by introducing a new and interesting notation for q-calculus based on logarithms.For instance, q-hypergeometric functions are now visually clear and easy to trace back to their hypergeometric parents. With this new notation it is also easy to see the connection between q-hypergeometric functions and the q-gamma function, something that until now has been overlooked. The book covers many topics on q-calculus, including special functions, combinatorics, and q-difference equations. Apart from a thorough review of the historical development of q-calculus, this book also presents the domains of modern physics for which q-calculus is applicable, such as particle physics and supersymmetry, to name just a few.​') ;

In this diverse set of essays, Angharad N. Valdivia breaks theoretical and methodological boundaries by exploring the relationship of the media to various audiences. Throughout A Latina in the Land of Hollywood we are challenged to think differently about the media messages we often unconsciously consume, such as the popular representations of certain Latina cultural icons. Valdivia shows how reporters focus on Guatemalan activist Rigoberta Menchús big smile, Brazilian media magnate Xuxas blonde hair, and Puerto Rican actress Rosie Perezs high-pitched voice, never quite creating a comprehensive portrayal of these women. In her discussion of lingerie catalogs, Valdivia uncovers a similarly skewed depiction. The lush, high-class bedrooms of Victorias Secret differ as much from the earthy, spare world of Fredericks of Hollywood as the types, sizes, and uses of the lingerie that the two companies sell. Valdivia takes a look at family films, arguing that single mothers are almost always portrayed as either trampy floozies or sexless, hapless women, whereas single dads fare much better. Whether examining one teenagers likes and dislikes or considering single parenthood in family films, Valdivia investigates how popular culture has become the arena in which we struggle to know ourselves and to make ourselves known. She calls for scholars to move beyond investigating implicit themes in films and media to studying the ways that audiences of different colors, ages, genders, and sexual preferences might understand or misunderstand such cultural messages. A Latina in the Land of Hollywood aims to explode traditional discussions of media and popular culture. It is a must-read for anyone interested in popular culture, television, and film.') ;

Insert into Summary (`BookID`,`Summary`) Values ('2602','This edition promises to redefine the canon of the study of appellate courts, continuing the comprehensiveness and increasing the depth of the First Edition. This edition of Appellate Courts provides teachers with choices that are suitable for a two- or three-unit course or a seminar. The book permits emphasis on either appellate jurisdiction and practice or on the structural and policy aspects of appellate court organization and administration. All the chapters have been revamped and updated, with coverage of appellate jurisdiction substantially expanded. Using both classic and new cases, the book examines theoretical and practical issues arising from the appellate courts dual roles to correct trial court error and to generate common law. Its coverage of the dramatic rise in the volume of appeals and the resultant institutional reforms far surpasses that of any other law school course book. Fresh materials present new perspectives on appellate structures, personnel, and procedures--preparing students to practice in the contemporary state and federal appellate courts. This provocative book considers such issues as the delegation of responsibility to law clerks and staff attorneys, the threats to judicial collegiality, the selection of state and federal judges--including the regulation of judicial candidates speech, and the role and ethics of the appellate lawyer. It devotes a separate chapter to the U.S. Supreme Courts discretionary jurisdiction while another chapter draws upon Professor Meadors unique understanding of the English and German appellate systems to contrast those systems with our own. In short, this book is unique in not only exploring appellate jurisdiction and procedure but also in taking the measure of the appellate courts in all their dimensions as important institutions in the American legal order. The Teachers Manual also has been updated and greatly expanded to assist both experienced and less-experienced teachers. It includes discussion of the principal cases and secondary materials as well as expert suggestions concerning answers to questions posed in the Notes. It also provides a wealth of supplemental material to bolster any professors expertise and make it easy for an instructor new to the subject to teach from the book effectively and confidently.') ;

This new book does an outstanding job of filling in the knowledge and perspective that engineers must have to be good citizens in areas ranging from the environment, to intellectual property, to ensuring the health of the innovation ecosystem that has done so much for modern society. This is exactly the sort of book that engineers and those who work with them should read and discuss over pizza, coffee, or some other suitable, discussion-provoking consumable. John L. Hennessy, president, Stanford University Citizen Engineer is the bible for the new era of socially responsible engineering. Its an era where, as the authors show, engineers dont just need to know more, they need to be more. The work is an inspiration, an exhortation, and a practical how-to guide. All engineers concerned with the impact of their work and that should be all engineers must read this book. Hal Abelson, professor of computer science and engineering, MIT Code is law. Finally, a map to responsible law making. This accessible and brilliant book should be required of every citizen, and especially, the new citizen lawmakers we call engineers. Lawrence Lessig, director, Safra Center for Ethics, Harvard University, and cofounder, Creative Commons Being an engineer today means being far more than an engineer. You need to consider not only the design requirements of your projects but the full impact of your work from an ecological perspective, an intellectual property perspective, a business perspective, and a sociological perspective. And you must coordinate your efforts with many other engineers, sometimes hundreds of them. In short, weve entered an age that demands socially responsible engineering on a whole new scale: The era of the Citizen Engineer. This engaging and thought-provoking book, written by computer industry luminaries David Douglas and Greg Papadopoulos, focuses on two topics that are becoming vitally important in the day-to-day work of engineers: eco engineering and intellectual property (IP). Citizen Engineer also examines how and why the world of engineering has changed, and provides practical advice to help engineers of all types master the new era and start thinking like Citizen Engineers.') ;

Insert into Summary (`BookID`,`Summary`) Values ('2672','This book offers a systematic treatment--the first in book form--of the development and use of cohomological induction to construct unitary representations. George Mackey introduced induction in 1950 as a real analysis construction for passing from a unitary representation of a closed subgroup of a locally compact group to a unitary representation of the whole group. Later a parallel construction using complex analysis and its associated co-homology theories grew up as a result of work by Borel, Weil, Harish-Chandra, Bott, Langlands, Kostant, and Schmid. Cohomological induction, introduced by Zuckerman, is an algebraic analog that is technically more manageable than the complex-analysis construction and leads to a large repertory of irreducible unitary representations of reductive Lie groups. The book, which is accessible to students beyond the first year of graduate school, will interest mathematicians and physicists who want to learn about and take advantage of the algebraic side of the representation theory of Lie groups. Cohomological Induction and Unitary Representations develops the necessary background in representation theory and includes an introductory chapter of motivation, a thorough treatment of the translation principle, and four appendices on algebra and analysis.') ;

Published during 2009–16, the seven years that Basu spent as a policymaker—first as chief economic adviser to the Government of India and then as chief economist of the World Bank—this volume draws on the work done by empirical economists and is rooted in analytics, even while addressing practical, down-to-earth problems. The papers having a direct bearing on economic policymaking in this quintessential compilation range from topics such as financial regulation, global policy coordination, aspects of the Indian economy like fiscal and monetary policy design, inflation management, food-grain policy and, more generally, the influence of theory on government policymaking.

In Concepts of Personality Joseph M. Wepman and Ralph W. Heine offer a comprehensive survey of classical and contemporary personality theory, including a wide array of examples of these two trends. If the psychologist holds to the premises of strict objectivity through controlled observations, he finds himself driven to the periphery of the very problem he seeks to understand. This is a place where the reliability of measurement and the validity and predictability of his instruments can often be specified, but only at the cost of abandoning the goal of useful generality or of application to the individual in his ordinary life circumstances. Concepts of Personality, unlike most books on the subject, is not limited to broad, general theories.

While reading this book it is fun and easy to read it. This book is best suitable for first time C++ readers, Covers all fast track topics of C++ for all Computer Science students and Professionals. This book introduces standard C++ and the key programming and design techniques supported by C++. Standard C++ is a far more powerful and polished language than the version of C++ introduced by the first edition of this book. This book presents every major C++ language feature and the standard library. It is organized around language and library facilities. However, features are presented in the context of their use. That is, the focus is on the language as the tool for design and programming rather than on the language in itself. This book demonstrates key techniques that make C++ effective and teaches the fundamental concepts necessary for mastery. As everyone knows that Author Harry is basically known for his Easy way- Programming without fear technique.

I have paid thousands of dollars on exclusive groups and paid forums to collect the information presented in this book. As you can imagine these are the highly guarded secrets of the elite of the FOREX traders, no one gives their living away, unless you pay them a price worth their living. However I have decided to make this information for ridiculously low price, because I am fed up with the brokers and the big banks taking advantage of the regular retail trader. Let me ask you a question? When was the last time you make money with FOREX? Even further more how much money you are willing to lose, until you give up? How long you will continue to give your hard earned money to the broker? Just like you I started 5 years ago with high hopes of quitting my job and leaving the live I deserve with FOREX. My hopes and aspirations were quickly crashed and my dreams went to the dump. First I lost 1000, then 5000, 10k , how much longer I could continue like that, how much longer I could endure the ridicule the jokes of my family and the frown on the face of my wife. It was painful, sitting all day in front of the computer, until you cant see any longer and everything including the platform and your mind become blurry. I know the pain I have been there. This continued for year, until one morning I was ready to quit, I was going to give it a last try and throw that FOREX staff in the garbage, out the window. I stumbled on a rear tread, which since then has been banned, by the broker that was holding the forum. Luckily the tread continued under the brokers radar for while, and gathered a bunch of comments an support. Finally the tread from the trader X was discontinued. I was in dis pare, that was the only hope and light, I have seen for a long time. I was applying the advice from the trade and things were starting to work for me. Fortunately I was able to PM the trader and begged him to agree on a 20 min conversation on the phone. Trader X was not a guru, not your regular internet promoter mojo. He was quietly raking in thousands of dollars a month for years, he was not excited about the next trade, his heart beat was not raising before he pooled the trigger. See, he has been doing this trading staff for so long it has become a boring procedure, rather a morning an afternoon chore, something like putting the garbage out on garbage day. He explained that he learned from the MASTER, I did not proceed to ask him who was the MASTER, since I mainly was concerned with him teaching him every little bit of what he knew about trading. He didnt not agree to spend time teaching me on our first conversation, regardless of how much I offered to pay him. See, for him money was not a issue. Finally on my third approach he agreed to show me what the MASTER had thought him many years ago. What is comprised in the pages of this book will be worth pure gold to you.This book is down to the ground no no sense, real trading knowledge. It gives step by step instructions with real trade examples. This book is not your regular hog wash advice that you will find from your broker and the other magic bullets and seven step series that you see on this site. This book teaches you how to trade like the pros. Shows you how the big banks and foreign nationals and institution trade. The book opens your eyes to how to piggy back on the big institutional traders and win. Ninety Five percent of the people that trade the Forex market lose money and give up. The market is continually replaced by fresh blood like yourself. Dont become part of the statistics, read this book and get a map to success in FOREX.

You may be mad at me at this moment,but soon will come the moment you will thank me .Or you would rather stumble on a nice guru telling you all the lies, and how he can help you open a 10k account with a secret advantage. Or worseHe can even offer to manage your 10k,if you so willingly send him a check for the whole amount.The book you are about to read is the hard learned secrets of the successful traders and brokers and I am putting it all out for you.See I dont really need the 10 bucks,but I am making sure you appreciate the value you are getting.I have made my share trading the market, paid for all the yachts cars and toys and the farm, now its your turn.I am sick and tired of the pain in the community and all the retail traders like yourself slaughtered by the hefty brokers.It is time to pay back, it is time for me to give back and to make sure the small trader has evened the plates no more secrets and golden grails uncovered.All the knowledge I am presenting in this book, comes from the school of hard knock, expensive paid Forex forums, where real traders hang out, not bothered by the rookies. Things I overheard on the golf course? Tell me about that, one of the guys I used to golf with executed only one trade a month, we used to call him the ONE TRADE GUY...How ridiculous that is? Hanging around,playing golf all month until a certain currency goes to a such and such monthly level, and pull the trigger to wipe out all the people with red eyes staring at the screens day and night,fighting with their spouses,wasting their lives in front of the broker platforms.I know what you are thinking this guy is full of it!Well, I am fed up with the usual story that hits every newbie trader like you and I dont want you to have anything to do with it.So, I am giving you a choice: take this book read it, study and devour every single strategy (however dont choke take it step by step), because its real, truth coming from a real trader (I wish I could stretch my hand over the monitor,I promise you!

First, it is written to address the needs of both the experienced practitioner and the entry-level public servant. Case examples bridge the content-rich environment of practitioners with the principles of public administration sought by pre-service students. Second, the discussion of management practices is grounded in the political and ethical tensions inherent in the American constitutional form of governance. This innovative approach reflects the authors belief that public administration operates as an integral part of the countrys political traditions, and thereby helps define the political culture. Key themes in this third edition include: - An emphasis on the ways in which public administration and their agents play a critical role in ensuring legal and political accountability of the political system. - An exploration of local public administration as the backstop of American democracy, requiring a close working partnership between part-time elected officials and career administrators. - Careful examination of the ways in which American political economy requires administrators who are skilled at co-producing the common good with voluntary associations, businesses, nonprofit organizations and other governmental entities. - An understanding that public administration plays a critical role with its prudential judgments in balancing the competing values necessary to secure a regime of ordered liberty. Every chapter has been thoroughly updated, with particular attention paid to chapters on budgeting and revenue, e-government and the digital divide, shared power and the rise of wicked problems,  and the future of public administration in the United States amidst deep polarization.

The program requires that the user supply input information such as the first and last channels of the region, the channels to be used as pre- and post-region background, the system gain and zero-intercept, and a list of approximate energy values at which peaks occur in the region. Because the peak position and peak-shape parameters enter nonlinearly into the peak-fitting algorithm, an iterative least-square procedure is used in the fitting process. The program iterates until either all convergence criteria are met or ten iterations have elapsed. The code described here allows for twenty free parameters and a region as large as 240 data channels. This code runs on an LSI-11 computer with 32K memory and disk-storage capability.') ;

Insert into Summary (`BookID`,`Summary`) Values ('2825','A literary treasure of over one hundred unpublished letters from National Book Award-winning author Flannery OConnor and her circle of extraordinary friends. Flannery O’Connor is a master of twentieth-century American fiction, joining, since her untimely death in 1964, the likes of Hawthorne, Hemingway, and Faulkner. Those familiar with her work know that her powerful ethical vision was rooted in a quiet, devout faith and informed all she wrote and did. Good Things Out of Nazareth, a much-anticipated collection of many of O’Connor’s previously unpublished letters—along with those of literary luminaries such as Walker Percy (The Moviegoer), Caroline Gordon (None Shall Look Back), Katherine Anne Porter (Ship of Fools), Robert Giroux and movie critic Stanley Kauffmann. The letters explore such themes as creativity, faith, suffering, and writing. Brought together, they form a riveting literary portrait of these friends, artists, and thinkers. Here we find their joys and loves, as well as their trials and tribulations as they struggle with doubt and illness while championing their beliefs and often confronting racism in American society during the civil rights era. Praise for Good Things Out of Nazareth “An epistolary group portrait that will appeal to readers interested in the Catholic underpinnings of OConnors life and work . . . These letters by the National Book Award–winning short story writer and her friends alternately fit and break the mold. Anyone looking for Southern literary gossip will find plenty of barbs. . . . But there’s also higher-toned talk on topics such as the symbolism in O’Connor’s work and the nature of free will.”—Kirkus Reviews “A fascinating set of Flannery O’Connor’s correspondence . . . The compilation is highlighted by gems from O’Connor’s writing mentor, Caroline Gordon. . . . While O’Connor’s milieu can seem intimidatingly insular, the volume allows readers to feel closer to the writer, by glimpsing O’Connor’s struggles with lupus, which sometimes leaves her bedridden or walking on crutches, and by hearing her famously strong Georgian accent in the colloquialisms she sprinkles throughout the letters. . . . This is an important addition to the knowledge of O’Connor, her world, and her writing.”—Publishers Weekly') ;

Εκείνος ζει διπλή ζωή. Εκείνη ζει και αναπνέει την άρνηση. Εκείνος αποφασίζει να φύγει. Εκείνη δεν έχει τίποτα πια να χάσει.Μέσα από την εναλλαγή των φωνών, η Σιωπηλή σύζυγος µιλάει για έναν γάµο που διαλύεται, για ένα ζευγάρι που οδεύει προς την καταστροφή, για παραχωρήσεις που είναι αδύνατον να γίνουν, για υποσχέσεις που δεν πρόκειται να εκπληρωθούν... «Με την κοµψή και επιδέξια πένα της σκιαγραφεί τα αντιµαχόµενα ψυχολογικά πορτρέτα δύο εραστών που µετατρέπονται σε υποτιθέµενο δολοφόνο και άτυχο θύµα, σε µια ιστορία που κανείς δεν πρόκειται να ξεχάσει σύντοµα.

Ambient temperature was increased from 28 to 43C and maintained at this level for 1.5-2.0 hours. Increases in cardiac output were small, variable (ranging from 0.3 to 1.8 liters/min.), and were caused by small increases both in heart rate and stroke volume. The greater cardiac output was temporally related more closely to the augmented stroke volume which was, in turn, closely related to cutaneous vadodilatation as demonstrated by the cutaneous opacity pulses, the implication being that the augmented stroke volume probably results from the greater cutaneous venous return. The ratio of increase in cardiac output to sweating was about the same as previously shown; changes in oral temperature were small in all subjects, averaging about 0.5F. Validation of the electrical impedance technic as a measure of right ventricular stroke output was accomplished in dogs through comparisons of pulmonary arterial blood flow (electromagnetic flowmeter) and dye dilution (cardiogreen) cardiac output with that obtained by the impedance method. The correlations between the three methods were 0.792 and 0.916, respectively. (Author).') ;

In this book, Christopher W. Hughes assesses developments in defence expenditure, civilmilitary relations, domestic and international militaryindustrial complexes, Japans procurement of regional and global power-projection capabilities, the expansion of USJapan cooperation, and attitudes towards nuclear weapons, constitutional revision and the use of military force. In all of these areas, dynamic and long-term changes outweigh Japans short-term political logjam over security policy. Hughes argues that many post-war constraints on Japans military role are still eroding, and that Tokyo is moving towards a more assertive military role and strengthened USJapan cooperation. Japans remilitarisation will boost its international security role and the dominance of the USJapan alliance in regional and global security affairs, but will need to be carefully managed if it is not to become a source of destabilising tensions.') ;
Insert into Summary (`BookID`,`Summary`) Values ('2885','Until 1860 John Ruskins writings were primarily about art and architecture; but his belief that good art can flourish only in a society that is sound and healthy led him inevitably to a preoccupation with social and economic problems, the dominant concern of his later writings. James Clark Sherburne provides in this volume a detailed and long overdue re-examination of Ruskins social and economic perceptions and, for the first time, systematically places these perceptions in their nineteenth-century intellectual context. Ruskins eloquence and the strength of his moral, aesthetic, and social convictions established him as one of the most influential of Victorian writers. His writings, however, are not easily categorized and many of his important insights occur as digressions in discussions of other topics. Mr. Sherburne succeeds in ordering and clarifying the rich chaos of Ruskins social thought without denying that wholeness which is, paradoxically, its salient feature. He discovers the source of Ruskins social criticism in his early writings. He then follows Ruskins interest as it shifts from economic theory to the problems of exploitation, war, imperialism, the means of social reform, and the construction of the welfare state. Ruskins remarkably early vision of the possibility of economic abundance, his anticipation of its social and personal implications, his much disparaged critique of classical economics, his pioneering attention to the role of the consumer and the quality of consumption, his anxious portrayal of the effects of industrialism on the environment, his critique of English educational methods, and his farsighted proposals for public management of industry and transport are among the many aspects of Ruskins thought examined by Mr. Sherburne. What emerges is an original and exhaustive study of a dimension of Ruskins work which, though much neglected, is particularly relevant to contemporary concerns.') ;

He lied about his exploits, joined the U.S. Army under an assumed name, and managed to alienate most of the people he met. Yet this Hungarian immigrant became one of the Smithsonian Institution’s most successful collectors of natural history specimens in the mid-nineteenth century, and he is credited with the discovery of many new species in the American West. From his station at Ft. Tejon in California’s Tehachapi Mountains, Xántus carried on a lengthy correspondence with Spencer Baird at the Smithsonian, to whom he shipped the specimens he had trapped or shot in the surrounding sierra and deserts. A prolific letter writer, Xántus faithfully reported his findings as he bemoaned his circumstances and worried about his future. Working from Smithsonian archives, natural history writer Ann Zwinger has assembled Xántus’s unpublished letters into a book that documents his trials and triumphs in the field and reveals much about his dubious character. The letters also bring to life a time and place on the western frontier from which Xántus was able to observe a broad panorama of American history in the making. Zwinger’s lively introduction sets the stage for Xántus’s correspondence and examines the apparent contradictions between the man’s personal and professional lives. Her detailed notes to the letters further clarify his discoveries and shed additional light on his checkered career.') ;

Given the trend towards regionalization of economic ties across the world, especially after the successful launch of the euro, a detailed analysis of the WAMZ is needed. As this is the first book on monetary and financial integration in Gambia, Ghana, Guinea, Nigeria and Sierra Leone, it is an essential read for anyone interested in economic development in West Africa, and indeed in Africa as a whole. This book is extremely well-researched, with detail on virtually all aspects of economic integration in the region; with issues ranging from the institutional details of integration, trade and financial market integration, to progress on convergence of macroeconomic fundamentals to the required payments system infrastructure. The book deploys solid empirical facts and sophisticated analyses to thoroughly defend its assertions. This collection is a valuable contribution and an excellent companion book for monetary economics or international economics classes as well as African development literature. It will provide students and researchers with an exciting chance to apply concepts of, for example, optimum currency areas, central bank structure or monetary policy approaches, to a real-world case of potential monetary union. Dr. Temitope W. Oshikoya and his collaborators have written the authoritative book on the subject of monetary union in the West African Monetary Zone.

In Movies, Songs, and Electric Sound, Charles O’Brien examines American and European musical films created circa 1930, when the world’s sound-equipped theaters screened movies featuring recorded songs and filmmakers in the United States and Europe struggled to meet the artistic and technical challenges of sound production and distribution. The presence of singers in films exerted special pressures on film technique, lending a distinct look and sound to the films’ musical sequences. Rather than advancing a film’s plot, songs in these films were staged, filmed, and cut to facilitate the singer’s engagement with her or his public. Through an examination of the export market for sound films in the early 1930s, when German and American companies used musical films as a vehicle for competing to control the world film trade, this book delineates a new transnational context for understanding the Hollywood musical. Combining archival research with the cinemetric analysis of hundreds of American, German, French, and British films made between 1927 and 1934, O’Brien provides the historical context necessary for making sense of the aesthetic impact of changes in film technology from the past to the present.') ;

In several respects he remains a contemporary figure, yet enough time has now passed for historians of philosophy to begin to study his place in twentieth century thought.

Written in what has been described as Dr. Flipsens folksy style, this text is designed for the busy clinician. The first five chapters of Remediation of /r/ for Speech-Language Pathologists delve into the basic information needed to treat /r/. The next six chapters each tackle a specific treatment option. The treatment section begins with a re-examination of traditional articulation therapy and uses research evidence to help clinicians to fine-tune its application. It then progresses to discussing more significant modifications to traditional therapy and introduces several newer approaches to modifying the feedback being provided to the client. For each treatment option, the author presents a solid rationale and the latest evidence, along with practical strategies for their implementation. The final chapter discusses methods for deciding which remediation method to choose when working with /r/ errors.') ;

These systems are able to tune the amount of damping in response to measured vehicle-ride and handling indicators. Two physically different dampers (magnetorheological and controlled-friction) are analysed from the perspectives of mechatronics and control. Ride comfort, road holding, road damage and human-body modelling are studied. Mathematical modelling is balanced by a large and detailed section on experimental implementation, where a variety of automotive applications are described offering a well-rounded view. The implementation of control algorithms with regard to real-life engineering constraints is emphasised. The applications described include semi-active suspensions for a saloon car, seat suspensions for vehicles not equipped with a primary suspension, and control of heavy-vehicle dynamic-tyre loads to reduce road damage and improve handling.') ;

The model predicts that information sharing of signals within social groups can facilitate information aggregation when the social groups are sufficiently large even when it is not predicted with individual signals. We use experiments in the laboratory and on Amazon Mechanical Turk to test these predictions. We find that information sharing in social groups significantly affects citizens protest decisions and as a consequence mitigates the effects of high conflict, leading to greater efficiency in policy makers choices. Our experiments highlight that social media can play an important role in protests beyond simply a way in which citizens can coordinate their actions; and indeed that the information aggregation and the coordination motives behind public protests are intimately connected and cannot be conceptually separated.') ;

Twenty-four experienced officer and warrant officer pilot personnel working with various map reference point conditions made direction estimates using 48 maps with a scale of 1:100,000 and 48 maps with a scale of 1:250,000. The effect of training was studied by using a test-train-retest-delay-retest procedure. Performance was measured in terms of absolute error, in degrees, between the estimated direction and the correct direction. Analyses showed that average error in direction estimation using tactical maps was reduced significantly by training, dropping from a mean of 6.1 degrees before training to 4.8 degrees after training. There were also significant differences in accuracy of direction estimates as a function of map scale, distance between reference points, and compass octant in which the reference points were located.

Whether it was an American ’plane operating from American escort carriers, US aircraft from Royal Air Force bases, or British aircraft from bases throughout the world, these officers and men became the most decisive factor in turning the tide of the Battle of the Atlantic against the German submarine threat. While the German crews could threaten escort vessels with torpedoes, or avoid them by remaining submerged, their leaders never developed an effective strategy against aircraft. However, the Allied aircraft did not enjoy much early success. British, Canadian and Australian air crews that fought the U-boats from 1939 until 1941 achieved few triumphs. They possessed neither the aircraft nor the bases necessary to deliver consistent lethal attacks against German submarines. In 1941, the Royal Air Force finally began implementing an effective aircraft response when it initiated training on the American-built Consolidated B-24 Liberators. Supported by other types then in service, these four-engine bombers would prove to be decisive. With America’s entry into the war, the United States Navy and the United States Army Air Forces also began employing Liberators against the U-boats so that by mid-1943, the Admiral Karl Dönitz, commander of U-boat forces, withdrew his submarines from the North Atlantic in recognition of the Allied aircraft’s new dominance. From Dönitz’s retreat to the end of the war, Allied aircraft continued to dominate the U-boat battle as it shifted to other areas including the Bay of Biscay. Dönitz eventually ordered his U-boats to remain on the surface and engage Allied aircraft as opposed to submerging. This approach did lead to the demise of some Allied aircraft, but it also resulted in even more U-boat being sunk.

Acclaimed writer Frank OConnor, a man who himself fought in the Irish Civil War, traces Collins life from the day he returned to Dublin to the day a young Irish soldier shot him dead on a country road. The Big Fellow achieves a narrative both probing and poetic as it chronicles the life of a man so charismatic that he made people aware of his presence even when he was not visible, through that uncomfortable magnetism of the very air, a tingling of the nerves.') ;

A total of 1514 discs are covered ranging from records released by such major hillbilly music stars as Jimmie Davis, the Sons of the Pioneers, and Ernest Tubb to those by less well-known solo artists and groups, including the Corn Cob Crushers and the Happy Hollow Hoodlums.

But because it has done so much important ideological work for the people who have written about it, the historical roots of the discourse have been obscured from view. What did it mean to talk about messiahs in the ancient world, before the idea of messianism became a philosophical juggernaut, dictating the terms for all subsequent discussion of the topic? In this book, Matthew V. Novenson offers a revisionist account of messianism in antiquity. He shows that, for the ancient Jews and Christians who used the term, a messiah was not an article of faith but a manner of speaking. It was a scriptural figure of speech, one among numerous others, useful for thinking about kinds of political order: present or future, real or ideal, monarchic or theocratic, dynastic or charismatic, and other variations besides. The early Christians famously seized upon the title messiah (in Greek, Christ) for their founding hero and molded the sense of the term in certain ways; but, Novenson shows, this is just what all ancient messiah texts do, each in its own way. If we hope to understand the ancient texts about messiahs (from Deutero-Isaiah to the Parables of Enoch, from the Qumran Community Rule to the Gospel of John, from the Pseudo-Clementines to Sefer Zerubbabel), we must learn to think not in terms of a world-historical idea but of a language game, of so many creative reuses of an archaic Israelite idiom. In The Grammar of Messianism, Novenson demonstrates the possibility and the benefit of thinking of messianism in this way.') ;

He shows that, for the ancient Jews and Christians who used the term, a messiah was not an article of faith but a manner of speaking. It was a scriptural figure of speech, one among numerous others, useful for thinking about kinds of political order: present or future, real or ideal, monarchic or theocratic, dynastic or charismatic, and other variations besides. The early Christians famously seized upon the title messiah (in Greek, Christ) for their founding hero and molded the sense of the term in certain ways; but, Novenson shows, this is just what all ancient messiah texts do, each in its own way. If we hope to understand the ancient texts about messiahs (from Deutero-Isaiah to the Parables of Enoch, from the Qumran Community Rule to the Gospel of John, from the Pseudo-Clementines to Sefer Zerubbabel), we must learn to think not in terms of a world-historical idea but of a language game, of so many creative reuses of an archaic Israelite idiom. In The Grammar of Messianism, Novenson demonstrates the possibility and the benefit of thinking of messianism in this way.') ;

In the first full historical study of its fortunes as a concept, Perry Anderson traces its emergence in Ancient Greece and its rediscovery during the upheavals of 1848–1849 in Germany. He then follows its checkered career in revolutionary Russia, fascist Italy, Cold War America, Gaullist France, Thatcher’s Britain, post-colonial India, feudal Japan, Maoist China, eventually arriving at the world of Merkel and May, Bush and Obama. The result is a surprising and fascinating expedition into global intellectual history, ending with reflections on the contemporary political landscape.') ;

Psychological first aid, or PFA, is designed to mitigate the effects of acute stress and trauma and assist those in crisis to cope effectively with adversity. PFA is designed to be applied in emergencies, including disasters and terrorist attacks. In this essential guide, George S. Everly, Jr., developer of the Johns Hopkins RAPID PFA method, and Jeffrey M. Lating, his collaborator in its implementation, describe the principles and practices underpinning this psychological model in an easy-to-follow, prescriptive, and practical manner. They explain the history of PFA and persuasively demonstrate its powerful versatility. Mental health practitioners can apply PFA in all settings. It can also be used as a public-health tool to address mental health needs following critical incidents and as a means for building community resilience. Aimed at mental health practitioners, all first responders, and global health disaster teams such as Médecins Sans Frontières and the World Health Organization, The Johns Hopkins Guide to Psychological First Aid is the first book to thoroughly explain RAPID PFA. RAPID, a unique theoretically grounded and evidence-based PFA method, follows a set of easily understood principles. In each chapter, Everly and Lating provide a step-by-step approach and include a key point summary to emphasize essential elements. A unifying case exemplifies each phase of the RAPID PFA model in an ongoing dialogue that presents ideal PFA responses, examples of common mistakes, and various outcomes. In addition to their counseling experience in Kuwait after the Gulf War and in New York City after the September 11 attacks, the authors have traveled nationally and internationally to teach the RAPID PFA method in numerous public health, fire, police, military, and faith-based settings. Beneficial to those with little or no previous mental health training, this book is an essential tool for people who want to learn, to practice, or to retain their ability to use psychological first aid effectively.') ;

Located at the intersection of Asia, Africa, and Europe, the Mediterranean has connected societies for millennia, creating a shared space of intense economic, cultural, and political interaction. Greek temples in Sicily, Roman ruins in North Africa, and Ottoman fortifications in Greece serve as reminders that the Mediterranean has no fixed national boundaries or stable ethnic and religious identities. In The Mediterranean World, Monique O’Connell and Eric R Dursteler examine the history of this contested region from the medieval to the early modern era, beginning with the fall of Rome around 500 CE and closing with Napoleon’s attempted conquest of Egypt in 1798. Arguing convincingly that the Mediterranean should be studied as a singular unit, the authors explore the centuries when no lone power dominated the Mediterranean Sea and invaders brought their own unique languages and cultures to the region. Structured around four interlocking themes—mobility, state development, commerce, and frontiers—this beautifully illustrated book brings new dimensions to the concepts of Mediterranean nationality and identity.') ;

Its time to fight back Shame is a powerful and sometimes useful tool. When we publicly shame corrupt politicians, abusive celebrities, or predatory corporations, we reinforce values of fairness and justice. But as best-selling author Cathy ONeil argues in this revelatory book, shaming has taken a new and dangerous turn. It is increasingly being weaponized -- used as a way to shift responsibility for social problems from institutions to individuals. Shaming children for not being able to afford school lunches or adults for not being able to find work lets us off the hook as a society. After all, why pay higher taxes to fund programmes for people who are fundamentally unworthy? ONeil explores the machinery behind all this shame, showing how governments, corporations and the healthcare system capitalize on it. There are damning stories of rehab clinics, reentry programs, drug and diet companies, and social media platforms -- all of which profit from punching down on the vulnerable. Woven throughout The Shame Machine is the story of ONeils own struggle with body image and her recent weight-loss surgery, which awakened her to the systematic shaming of fat people seeking medical care. With clarity and nuance, ONeil dissects the relationship between shame and power. Whom does the system serve? How do current incentive structures perpetuate the shaming cycle? And, most important, how can we all fight back?') ;

But as best-selling author Cathy ONeil argues in this revelatory book, shaming has taken a new and dangerous turn. It is increasingly being weaponized -- used as a way to shift responsibility for social problems from institutions to individuals. Shaming children for not being able to afford school lunches or adults for not being able to find work lets us off the hook as a society. After all, why pay higher taxes to fund programmes for people who are fundamentally unworthy? ONeil explores the machinery behind all this shame, showing how governments, corporations and the healthcare system capitalize on it. There are damning stories of rehab clinics, reentry programs, drug and diet companies, and social media platforms -- all of which profit from punching down on the vulnerable. Woven throughout The Shame Machine is the story of ONeils own struggle with body image and her recent weight-loss surgery, which awakened her to the systematic shaming of fat people seeking medical care. With clarity and nuance, ONeil dissects the relationship between shame and power. Whom does the system serve? How do current incentive structures perpetuate the shaming cycle?

Dreams and spoken language in particular emerge as crucial sites of unconscious mental activity, providing a wealth of material on which one can base a comparative study of Proustian and Freudian models of the mind.') ;

Spiritual devotions, or the three spiritual disciplines comprise Bible reading, prayer and pondering the word of God, or what we call godly meditation. This meditation is the musing and mental study of heavenly truths. It is working the practical truths of the Bible into one’s soul. In this, Christians are captivated with God’s disclosure of heavenly truths to them in the bible. In the bible God displays himself to them. God is the infinite First-being, worthy of all love for Himself, and communicates that love to His people. They in turn love him back. Loving him back includes thinking about him. Though Christians live in the world, they have communion with the God of heaven through the word of God, throughout the whole course of their lives. They do this through godly meditation. Allestree not only shows what meditation is, and how it is to be done, but gives the reader twenty-eight meditations so that he can enter into a profitable time of daily meditation by practical example.

W-Sn skarns are notoriously complex, containing a wide range of textures, grain sizes, mineral assemblages, bulk compositions and structures. The lack of a sufficiently detailed data base, coupled with some unsupportable genetic models, has led to many misunderstandings and has often resulted in needless expenditure and effort on fruitless mineral exploration.

Hirschman, one of the twentieth centurys most original and provocative thinkers. In this gripping biography, Jeremy Adelman tells the story of a man shaped by modern horrors and hopes, a worldly intellectual who fought for and wrote in defense of the values of tolerance and change. Born in Berlin in 1915, Hirschman grew up amid the promise and turmoil of the Weimar era, but fled Germany when the Nazis seized power in 1933. Amid hardship and personal tragedy, he volunteered to fight against the fascists in Spain and helped many of Europes leading artists and intellectuals escape to America after France fell to Hitler. His intellectual career led him to Paris, London, and Trieste, and to academic appointments at Columbia, Harvard, and the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton. He was an influential adviser to governments in the United States, Latin America, and Europe, as well as major foundations and the World Bank. Along the way, he wrote some of the most innovative and important books in economics, the social sciences, and the history of ideas. Throughout, he remained committed to his belief that reform is possible, even in the darkest of times.

In this diverse set of essays, Angharad N. Valdivia breaks theoretical and methodological boundaries by exploring the relationship of the media to various audiences. Throughout A Latina in the Land of Hollywood we are challenged to think differently about the media messages we often unconsciously consume, such as the popular representations of certain Latina cultural icons. Valdivia shows how reporters focus on Guatemalan activist Rigoberta Menchús big smile, Brazilian media magnate Xuxas blonde hair, and Puerto Rican actress Rosie Perezs high-pitched voice, never quite creating a comprehensive portrayal of these women. In her discussion of lingerie catalogs, Valdivia uncovers a similarly skewed depiction. The lush, high-class bedrooms of Victorias Secret differ as much from the earthy, spare world of Fredericks of Hollywood as the types, sizes, and uses of the lingerie that the two companies sell. Valdivia takes a look at family films, arguing that single mothers are almost always portrayed as either trampy floozies or sexless, hapless women, whereas single dads fare much better. Whether examining one teenagers likes and dislikes or considering single parenthood in family films, Valdivia investigates how popular culture has become the arena in which we struggle to know ourselves and to make ourselves known. She calls for scholars to move beyond investigating implicit themes in films and media to studying the ways that audiences of different colors, ages, genders, and sexual preferences might understand or misunderstand such cultural messages. A Latina in the Land of Hollywood aims to explode traditional discussions of media and popular culture. It is a must-read for anyone interested in popular culture, television, and film.') ;

Since Jesus clearly intended for the church to remain visibly united, the burden of proof on any theological innovation is heavy, and Koons demonstrates that the Lutheran doctrine was innovative, and he argues, relying on the best New Testament scholarship, that the Bible passages cited by the Reformers do not support the innovative features of the Lutheran doctrine.

Officers and men of the navys four-piper destroyers began by investigating circumstances on the ground in mainland Turkey right after World War I, and by transporting American relief teams to ports throughout Turkey and Southern Russia to aid the tens of thousands of orphans and refugees who had survived the wartime Armenian genocide. Then the destroyers assisted in the final evacuation of 150,000 White Russians from the Crimea to Constantinople (one of the final acts of the Russian Revolution); coordinated the visits of the Hoover grain ships to ports in Southern Russia where millions were enduring a horrendous famine; witnessed and reported on the terrible dolorosa of the Greeks of the Pontus regious of Turkey; and, in September of 1922, conducted the evacuation of hundreds of thousands of Greek and Armenian refugees from burning Smyrna. This latter event was the cataclysmic conclusion of the Turkish Nationalist Revolutino, which had begun in early 1920. After Smyrna, the destroyers escorted Greek steamers in their rescue of ethnic Christian civilians being expelled from all the ports of Anatolian Turkey. As the conclusion of a long war between Nationalist Turks and an invading Hellenic Greek army, these people were being forced out of their ancestral homes by the Turks. Sometimes American destroyers carried hundreds of such refugees to friendly ports on their own weather decks. Upon the burning of Smyrna of September of 1922, Admiral Mark Bristols small fleet had grown to some 26 naval vessels, most of them destroyers, although some cruisers, naval repair vessels and supply ships also came, and the battleships Arizona and Utah also appeared briefly. It was during 1922 that the destroyer BAinbridge rescued 482 of 495 men, women and children from the burning French transport Vinh Long in teh Sea of Marmora. The destroyer accomplished this by the expedient of ramming the large French ship so the exploding ammunition could not continue to force the vessels apart. For this action, Lieut.Commander W. Atlee Edwards was awarded the Medal of Honor by America, and the Legion of Honor by France. Over four years, Admiral Bristol maintained a strong grip on American naval and diplomatic affairs throughout the region. Headquartered at the American Embassy at Constantinople, Bristol also worked to further American business interests in Turkey, and tended to favor Turks over Greeks and Armenians in the process.

The various Jewish holy sites described in the Bible possessed multiple different meanings for Bede and therefore this imagery provides an excellent window into his thought. Bedes Temple: An Image and its Interpretation examines Bedes use of the temple to reveal his ideas of history, the universe, Christ, the Church, and the individual Christian. Across his wide body of writings Bede presented an image of unity, whether that be the unity of Jew and gentile in the universal Church, or the unity of human and divine in the incarnate Christ, and the temple-image provided a means of understanding and celebrating that unity. Conor OBrien argues that Bedes understanding of the temple was part of the shared spirituality and communal discourse of his monastery at Wearmouth-Jarrow, in particular as revealed in the great illuminated Bible made there: the Codex Amiatinus. Studying the temple in Bedes works reveals not just an individual genius, but a monastic community engaged actively in scriptural interpretation and religious reflection.

The aim of this book is to list every reference to William Blake published between 1757 and 1863 and every criticism and edition of his works from the beginning to the present. Partly because of the deluge of scholarship in the last forty years, it includes perhaps twice as many titles as Sir Geoffrey Keyness great bibliography of 1921. An introductory essay on the history of Blake scholarship puts the most significant works into perspective, indicates the best work that has been done, and points to some neglected areas. In addition, all the most important references and many of the less significant ones are briefly annotated as to subject and value. Because many of the works are difficult to locate, specimen copies of all works published before 1831 have been traced to specific libraries. Each of Blakes manuscripts is also traced to its present owner. Two areas which have received relatively novel attention are early references to Blake (before 1863) and important sale and exhibition catalogues of his works. In both areas there are significant number of important entries which have not been noticed before by Blake scholars.

George Mackey introduced induction in 1950 as a real analysis construction for passing from a unitary representation of a closed subgroup of a locally compact group to a unitary representation of the whole group. Later a parallel construction using complex analysis and its associated co-homology theories grew up as a result of work by Borel, Weil, Harish-Chandra, Bott, Langlands, Kostant, and Schmid. Cohomological induction, introduced by Zuckerman, is an algebraic analog that is technically more manageable than the complex-analysis construction and leads to a large repertory of irreducible unitary representations of reductive Lie groups. The book, which is accessible to students beyond the first year of graduate school, will interest mathematicians and physicists who want to learn about and take advantage of the algebraic side of the representation theory of Lie groups.

While private schools catering to the poorer sections have been proliferating, little is known about how these low-fee private schools operate, how choices and negotiations unfold, the classroom discourses, subjective meanings of different stakeholders, and the kind of education provided in these schools vis-à-vis the government schools.

Laboratory performance test results on field cores and asphalt mixtures showed that baghouse fines had a stiffening effect on mixtures and these mixtures were more resistant to rutting. However, mixtures containing baghouse fines were found to be moisture-sensitive, with tensile stress ratios below that specified by NCDOT.') ;

Starting from the strengths of his classic Elements of Chemical Reaction Engineering, Fourth Edition, in this volume H. Scott Fogler added new material and distilled the essentials for undergraduate students. Foglers unique way of presenting the material helps students gain a deep, intuitive understanding of the fields essentials through reasoning, using a CRE algorithm, not memorization. He especially focuses on important new energy and safety issues, ranging from solar and biomass applications to the avoidance of runaway reactions. Thoroughly classroom tested, this text reflects feedback from hundreds of students at the University of Michigan and other leading universities. It also provides new resources to help students discover how reactors behave in diverse situations--including many realistic, interactive simulations on DVD-ROM.New Coverage Includes * Greater emphasis on safety: following the recommendations of the* Chemical Safety Board (CSB), discussion of crucial safety topics, including ammonium nitrate CSTR explosions, case studies of the nitroaniline explosion, and the T2 Laboratories batch reactor runaway* Solar energy conversions: chemical, thermal, and catalytic water spilling* Algae production for biomass* Steady-state nonisothermal reactor design: flow reactors with heat exchange* Unsteady-state nonisothermal reactor design with case studies of reactor explosions About the DVD-ROM The DVD contains six additional, graduate-level chapters covering catalyst decay, external diffusion effects on heterogeneous reactions, diffusion and reaction, distribution of residence times for reactors, models for non-ideal reactors, and radial and axial temperature variations in tubular reactions.Extensive additional DVD resources include * Summary notes, Web modules, additional examples, derivations, audio commentary, and self-tests* Interactive computer games that review and apply important chapter concepts* Innovative Living Example Problems with Polymath code that can be loaded directly from the DVD so students can play with the solution to get an innate feeling of how reactors operate* A 15-day trial of Polymatha is included, along with a link to the Fogler Polymath site* A complete, new AspenTech tutorial, and four complete example problems* Visual Encyclopedia of Equipment, Reactor Lab, and other intuitive tools* More than 500 PowerPoint slides of lecture notes Additional updates, applications, and information are available at www.umich.edu/ essen and www.essentialsofcre.com.') ;

However I have decided to make this information for ridiculously low price, because I am fed up with the brokers and the big banks taking advantage of the regular retail trader. Let me ask you a question? When was the last time you make money with FOREX? Even further more how much money you are willing to lose, until you give up? How long you will continue to give your hard earned money to the broker? Just like you I started 5 years ago with high hopes of quitting my job and leaving the live I deserve with FOREX. My hopes and aspirations were quickly crashed and my dreams went to the dump. First I lost 1000, then 5000, 10k , how much longer I could continue like that, how much longer I could endure the ridicule the jokes of my family and the frown on the face of my wife. It was painful, sitting all day in front of the computer, until you cant see any longer and everything including the platform and your mind become blurry. I know the pain I have been there. This continued for year, until one morning I was ready to quit, I was going to give it a last try and throw that FOREX staff in the garbage, out the window. I stumbled on a rear tread, which since then has been banned, by the broker that was holding the forum. Luckily the tread continued under the brokers radar for while, and gathered a bunch of comments an support. Finally the tread from the trader X was discontinued. I was in dis pare, that was the only hope and light, I have seen for a long time. I was applying the advice from the trade and things were starting to work for me. Fortunately I was able to PM the trader and begged him to agree on a 20 min conversation on the phone. Trader X was not a guru, not your regular internet promoter mojo. He was quietly raking in thousands of dollars a month for years, he was not excited about the next trade, his heart beat was not raising before he pooled the trigger. See, he has been doing this trading staff for so long it has become a boring procedure, rather a morning an afternoon chore, something like putting the garbage out on garbage day. He explained that he learned from the MASTER, I did not proceed to ask him who was the MASTER, since I mainly was concerned with him teaching him every little bit of what he knew about trading. He didnt not agree to spend time teaching me on our first conversation, regardless of how much I offered to pay him. See, for him money was not a issue. Finally on my third approach he agreed to show me what the MASTER had thought him many years ago. What is comprised in the pages of this book will be worth pure gold to you.This book is down to the ground no no sense, real trading knowledge. It gives step by step instructions with real trade examples.

Insert into Summary (`BookID`,`Summary`) Values ('3580','Designed to serve as a basic text for introductory courses in public administration, this pioneering work provides students with a clear-eyed understanding of the vital management functions covered in most standard textbooks with two important differences. First, it is written to address the needs of both the experienced practitioner and the entry-level public servant. Case examples bridge the content-rich environment of practitioners with the principles of public administration sought by pre-service students. Second, the discussion of management practices is grounded in the political and ethical tensions inherent in the American constitutional form of governance. This innovative approach reflects the authors belief that public administration operates as an integral part of the countrys political traditions, and thereby helps define the political culture. Key themes in this third edition include: - An emphasis on the ways in which public administration and their agents play a critical role in ensuring legal and political accountability of the political system. - An exploration of local public administration as the backstop of American democracy, requiring a close working partnership between part-time elected officials and career administrators. - Careful examination of the ways in which American political economy requires administrators who are skilled at co-producing the common good with voluntary associations, businesses, nonprofit organizations and other governmental entities. - An understanding that public administration plays a critical role with its prudential judgments in balancing the competing values necessary to secure a regime of ordered liberty. Every chapter has been thoroughly updated, with particular attention paid to chapters on budgeting and revenue, e-government and the digital divide, shared power and the rise of wicked problems,  and the future of public administration in the United States amidst deep polarization. Foundations of Public Service, 3rd Edition provides a framework for understanding American political traditions and how they inform public administration as a political practice. It is required reading for all introductory Public Administration courses with an emphasis on practice and real-world applications.') ;

Because the peak position and peak-shape parameters enter nonlinearly into the peak-fitting algorithm, an iterative least-square procedure is used in the fitting process.

Flannery O’Connor is a master of twentieth-century American fiction, joining, since her untimely death in 1964, the likes of Hawthorne, Hemingway, and Faulkner. Those familiar with her work know that her powerful ethical vision was rooted in a quiet, devout faith and informed all she wrote and did. Good Things Out of Nazareth, a much-anticipated collection of many of O’Connor’s previously unpublished letters—along with those of literary luminaries such as Walker Percy (The Moviegoer), Caroline Gordon (None Shall Look Back), Katherine Anne Porter (Ship of Fools), Robert Giroux and movie critic Stanley Kauffmann. The letters explore such themes as creativity, faith, suffering, and writing. Brought together, they form a riveting literary portrait of these friends, artists, and thinkers. Here we find their joys and loves, as well as their trials and tribulations as they struggle with doubt and illness while championing their beliefs and often confronting racism in American society during the civil rights era.

These letters by the National Book Award–winning short story writer and her friends alternately fit and break the mold. Anyone looking for Southern literary gossip will find plenty of barbs. . . . But there’s also higher-toned talk on topics such as the symbolism in O’Connor’s work and the nature of free will.”—Kirkus Reviews “A fascinating set of Flannery O’Connor’s correspondence . . . The compilation is highlighted by gems from O’Connor’s writing mentor, Caroline Gordon. . . . While O’Connor’s milieu can seem intimidatingly insular, the volume allows readers to feel closer to the writer, by glimpsing O’Connor’s struggles with lupus, which sometimes leaves her bedridden or walking on crutches, and by hearing her famously strong Georgian accent in the colloquialisms she sprinkles throughout the letters. . . . This is an important addition to the knowledge of O’Connor, her world, and her writing.”—Publishers Weekly') ;

Here we find their joys and loves, as well as their trials and tribulations as they struggle with doubt and illness while championing their beliefs and often confronting racism in American society during the civil rights era. Praise for Good Things Out of Nazareth “An epistolary group portrait that will appeal to readers interested in the Catholic underpinnings of OConnors life and work . . . These letters by the National Book Award–winning short story writer and her friends alternately fit and break the mold. Anyone looking for Southern literary gossip will find plenty of barbs. . . . But there’s also higher-toned talk on topics such as the symbolism in O’Connor’s work and the nature of free will.”—Kirkus Reviews “A fascinating set of Flannery O’Connor’s correspondence . . . The compilation is highlighted by gems from O’Connor’s writing mentor, Caroline Gordon. . . . While O’Connor’s milieu can seem intimidatingly insular, the volume allows readers to feel closer to the writer, by glimpsing O’Connor’s struggles with lupus, which sometimes leaves her bedridden or walking on crutches, and by hearing her famously strong Georgian accent in the colloquialisms she sprinkles throughout the letters. . . . This is an important addition to the knowledge of O’Connor, her world, and her writing.”—Publishers Weekly') ;

To what extent has the mass culture of the movie industry itself been conceptually shaped by a broad, external societal discourse? Norman Denzin brings to his life-long study of alcoholism a searching interest in how cultural texts signify and lend themselves to interpretation within a social nexus. Both historical and diachronic in his approach, Denzin identifies five periods in the alcoholism films made between 1932 and the end of the 1980s, and offers a detailed critical reading of thirty-seven films produced during these six decades. Professor Denzin has produced a searching and provocative interpretation of more than a half-century of Hollywoods social and personal construction of the problem drinker in America. Readable by both lay persons and specialists, Denzins book provides us with the most comprehensive understanding of this topic to date.--Stanford M. Lyman, Robert J. Morrow Eminent Scholar in Social Science, Florida Atlantic University An eminent sociologist and leading authority on alcoholism, Denzin also writes skillfully about films as films and is comfortable with postmodern interpretive theoryàa genuinely interdisciplinary work of the first order. --Robert L. Carringer, author, The Making of Citizen Kane Denzin has gone on an exhaustive bar-crawl through hundreds of movies, returning with evidence that the film about drinking is a genre of its own. He writes from sound knowledge about alcoholism--which, unlike other diseases, is frequently viewed with bittersweet romanticism.--Roger Ebert Norman K. Denzin is professor of sociology, cinema studies, and interpretive theory at the University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign. He was awarded the George Herbert Mead Award for Lifetime Achievement from the Society for the Study of Symbolic Interaction. He is the author of several books, including Screening Race: Hollywood and a Cinema of Racial Violence, The Recovering Alcoholic, Interpretive Ethnography, Images of Postmodernism: Social Theory and Contemporary Cinema, and Interpretive Interactionism.') ;

Increases in cardiac output were small, variable (ranging from 0.3 to 1.8 liters/min.), and were caused by small increases both in heart rate and stroke volume. The greater cardiac output was temporally related more closely to the augmented stroke volume which was, in turn, closely related to cutaneous vadodilatation as demonstrated by the cutaneous opacity pulses, the implication being that the augmented stroke volume probably results from the greater cutaneous venous return. The ratio of increase in cardiac output to sweating was about the same as previously shown; changes in oral temperature were small in all subjects, averaging about 0.5F. Validation of the electrical impedance technic as a measure of right ventricular stroke output was accomplished in dogs through comparisons of pulmonary arterial blood flow (electromagnetic flowmeter) and dye dilution (cardiogreen) cardiac output with that obtained by the impedance method.

It is thus crucial to provide statisticians with a practical understanding of those methods, and there is no better way to develop intuition and skills for simulation than to use simulation to solve statistical problems. Introducing Monte Carlo Methods with R covers the main tools used in statistical simulation from a programmers point of view, explaining the R implementation of each simulation technique and providing the output for better understanding and comparison. While this book constitutes a comprehensive treatment of simulation methods, the theoretical justification of those methods has been considerably reduced, compared with Robert and Casella (2004). Similarly, the more exploratory and less stable solutions are not covered here. This book does not require a preliminary exposure to the R programming language or to Monte Carlo methods, nor an advanced mathematical background. While many examples are set within a Bayesian framework, advanced expertise in Bayesian statistics is not required. The book covers basic random generation algorithms, Monte Carlo techniques for integration and optimization, convergence diagnoses, Markov chain Monte Carlo methods, including Metropolis {Hastings and Gibbs algorithms, and adaptive algorithms. All chapters include exercises and all R programs are available as an R package called mcsm. The book appeals to anyone with a practical interest in simulation methods but no previous exposure. It is meant to be useful for students and practitioners in areas such as statistics, signal processing, communications engineering, control theory, econometrics, finance and more. The programming parts are introduced progressively to be accessible to any reader.') ;

In all of these areas, dynamic and long-term changes outweigh Japans short-term political logjam over security policy.

James Clark Sherburne provides in this volume a detailed and long overdue re-examination of Ruskins social and economic perceptions and, for the first time, systematically places these perceptions in their nineteenth-century intellectual context. Ruskins eloquence and the strength of his moral, aesthetic, and social convictions established him as one of the most influential of Victorian writers. His writings, however, are not easily categorized and many of his important insights occur as digressions in discussions of other topics. Mr. Sherburne succeeds in ordering and clarifying the rich chaos of Ruskins social thought without denying that wholeness which is, paradoxically, its salient feature. He discovers the source of Ruskins social criticism in his early writings. He then follows Ruskins interest as it shifts from economic theory to the problems of exploitation, war, imperialism, the means of social reform, and the construction of the welfare state. Ruskins remarkably early vision of the possibility of economic abundance, his anticipation of its social and personal implications, his much disparaged critique of classical economics, his pioneering attention to the role of the consumer and the quality of consumption, his anxious portrayal of the effects of industrialism on the environment, his critique of English educational methods, and his farsighted proposals for public management of industry and transport are among the many aspects of Ruskins thought examined by Mr. Sherburne.

In Movies, Songs, and Electric Sound, Charles O’Brien examines American and European musical films created circa 1930, when the world’s sound-equipped theaters screened movies featuring recorded songs and filmmakers in the United States and Europe struggled to meet the artistic and technical challenges of sound production and distribution. The presence of singers in films exerted special pressures on film technique, lending a distinct look and sound to the films’ musical sequences. Rather than advancing a film’s plot, songs in these films were staged, filmed, and cut to facilitate the singer’s engagement with her or his public. Through an examination of the export market for sound films in the early 1930s, when German and American companies used musical films as a vehicle for competing to control the world film trade, this book delineates a new transnational context for understanding the Hollywood musical. Combining archival research with the cinemetric analysis of hundreds of American, German, French, and British films made between 1927 and 1934, O’Brien provides the historical context necessary for making sense of the aesthetic impact of changes in film technology from the past to the present.') ;

In addition to a discussion of traditional articulation therapy and ways to improve the administration of this technique, this practical text offers a detailed review and explanation of several very promising alternative approaches. Written in what has been described as Dr. Flipsens folksy style, this text is designed for the busy clinician. The first five chapters of Remediation of /r/ for Speech-Language Pathologists delve into the basic information needed to treat /r/. The next six chapters each tackle a specific treatment option. The treatment section begins with a re-examination of traditional articulation therapy and uses research evidence to help clinicians to fine-tune its application. It then progresses to discussing more significant modifications to traditional therapy and introduces several newer approaches to modifying the feedback being provided to the client. For each treatment option, the author presents a solid rationale and the latest evidence, along with practical strategies for their implementation.

He was too busy being pulled in all directions by life. His kids were often at odds with each other, and he and his wife seemed to be continuously just trying to hold everything together. Good days were few and far between. He didnt expect death to come when it did. He wasn’t prepared for it, but it came anyway. He soon found himself in a world out of his control, a world he had never imagined during his earthly life.

Twenty-four experienced officer and warrant officer pilot personnel working with various map reference point conditions made direction estimates using 48 maps with a scale of 1:100,000 and 48 maps with a scale of 1:250,000. The effect of training was studied by using a test-train-retest-delay-retest procedure. Performance was measured in terms of absolute error, in degrees, between the estimated direction and the correct direction. Analyses showed that average error in direction estimation using tactical maps was reduced significantly by training, dropping from a mean of 6.1 degrees before training to 4.8 degrees after training. There were also significant differences in accuracy of direction estimates as a function of map scale, distance between reference points, and compass octant in which the reference points were located.

This unique discography provides for the first time in print a systematic numerical listing and cross-referencing of all released recordings in the 5000 and 17000 Cajun series as well as records released under Deccas Champion 45000 and Montgomery Ward series, also devoted to hillbilly music. A total of 1514 discs are covered ranging from records released by such major hillbilly music stars as Jimmie Davis, the Sons of the Pioneers, and Ernest Tubb to those by less well-known solo artists and groups, including the Corn Cob Crushers and the Happy Hollow Hoodlums. Based on painstaking research in the original session books, ledgers, and label copy books as well as interviews with musicians and singers who participated in Decca recording sessions, this discography of one of the most remarkable record series of the 20th century makes a major contribution to the study of contemporary American music. The volume begins with an introduction which traces the early history of the Decca Record Company and its impact on hillbilly music of the 1930s and 1940s. Cary Ginell demonstrates that the Decca 5000 and other hillbilly series had a major role not only in documenting the history of hillbilly music but also in affecting its course by influencing future recording artists in the genre. Following a brief section which describes how to use the discography and the indexes, the discography itself is divided into four separate numerical listings: Decca 5000, Decca 17000, Decca/Champion 45000, and Montgomery Ward recordings. Each listing includes information about recording dates, master numbers, unissued titles, song titles and legends, songwriter credits, and release dates.

Insert into Summary (`BookID`,`Summary`) Values ('3961','Through its Decca 5000 series of the 1930s and 1940s, the American Decca recording company became the most influential record label in the burgeoning hillbilly music category, the forerunner of todays country and western music. This unique discography provides for the first time in print a systematic numerical listing and cross-referencing of all released recordings in the 5000 and 17000 Cajun series as well as records released under Deccas Champion 45000 and Montgomery Ward series, also devoted to hillbilly music. A total of 1514 discs are covered ranging from records released by such major hillbilly music stars as Jimmie Davis, the Sons of the Pioneers, and Ernest Tubb to those by less well-known solo artists and groups, including the Corn Cob Crushers and the Happy Hollow Hoodlums. Based on painstaking research in the original session books, ledgers, and label copy books as well as interviews with musicians and singers who participated in Decca recording sessions, this discography of one of the most remarkable record series of the 20th century makes a major contribution to the study of contemporary American music. The volume begins with an introduction which traces the early history of the Decca Record Company and its impact on hillbilly music of the 1930s and 1940s. Cary Ginell demonstrates that the Decca 5000 and other hillbilly series had a major role not only in documenting the history of hillbilly music but also in affecting its course by influencing future recording artists in the genre. Following a brief section which describes how to use the discography and the indexes, the discography itself is divided into four separate numerical listings: Decca 5000, Decca 17000, Decca/Champion 45000, and Montgomery Ward recordings. Each listing includes information about recording dates, master numbers, unissued titles, song titles and legends, songwriter credits, and release dates. Five indexes--artist, matrix and location, release dates, composer credits, and title--provide enhanced access to the main listings. Scholars and researchers of American country and folk music, both once included under the hillbilly banner--will find this discography an indispensable resource.') ;

Psychological first aid, or PFA, is designed to mitigate the effects of acute stress and trauma and assist those in crisis to cope effectively with adversity. PFA is designed to be applied in emergencies, including disasters and terrorist attacks. In this essential guide, George S. Everly, Jr., developer of the Johns Hopkins RAPID PFA method, and Jeffrey M. Lating, his collaborator in its implementation, describe the principles and practices underpinning this psychological model in an easy-to-follow, prescriptive, and practical manner. They explain the history of PFA and persuasively demonstrate its powerful versatility. Mental health practitioners can apply PFA in all settings. It can also be used as a public-health tool to address mental health needs following critical incidents and as a means for building community resilience. Aimed at mental health practitioners, all first responders, and global health disaster teams such as Médecins Sans Frontières and the World Health Organization, The Johns Hopkins Guide to Psychological First Aid is the first book to thoroughly explain RAPID PFA. RAPID, a unique theoretically grounded and evidence-based PFA method, follows a set of easily understood principles. In each chapter, Everly and Lating provide a step-by-step approach and include a key point summary to emphasize essential elements. A unifying case exemplifies each phase of the RAPID PFA model in an ongoing dialogue that presents ideal PFA responses, examples of common mistakes, and various outcomes. In addition to their counseling experience in Kuwait after the Gulf War and in New York City after the September 11 attacks, the authors have traveled nationally and internationally to teach the RAPID PFA method in numerous public health, fire, police, military, and faith-based settings. Beneficial to those with little or no previous mental health training, this book is an essential tool for people who want to learn, to practice, or to retain their ability to use psychological first aid effectively.') ;

In so doing, List shows that Englands rise as a commercial power was not facilitated by free markets but by protectionism, drawing his theory from historical fact rather than the other way around. Lists avowed liberalism is overshadowed by his illiberal priors, and so the economic history of the 20th century was one of Listian principles being put to use by illiberal regimes such as Russia, China, and Germany. His thought also governed the economic policy of another developmental state for over a century-America. Smith and Marx formed the basis of 20th century economic theory. But Friedrich List stands as a colossus astride the 20th century, forming the basis of economic practice for all major powers until mid-century. In his introduction to this edition, Francis OBeirne shows that the great economic clash has never been between capitalism and socialism, but between capitalism and nationalism, with Marxism a revolutionary force, but an economic irrelevancy.') ;

I knew I had the beginning of a great thing, a great truth in architecture. -Frank Lloyd Wright Early on the morning of June 4, 1905, lightning struck the steeple of Unity Church in the Chicago suburb of Oak Park, igniting a fire that would raze the building to the ground. The Unitarian congregation suddenly needed a home and turned to local architect Frank Lloyd Wright for a new approach. Thus begins the story of a watershed moment in the career of the worlds most influential architect and in the history of twentieth-century architecture and design. Wrights design for Unity Temple was radical in its simplicity-a monolithic concrete exterior-yet sublime in its detail and revolutionary in its use of interior space. With Wrights execution of Unity Temple, the ideas hed been working on and experimenting with for years were finally brought to fruition, and modern design was born. But it might never have happened if not for a devoted Unitarian congregation who embraced Wrights ideas and remained faithful to the architect and his vision through the trials and calamities of construction. Unity Temple, when completed in 1909, was-and still is-considered one of the landmarks of modern architecture. Author David M. Sokol poured more than 20 years of research into The Noble Room and uncovers a dramatic tale-much of which turns out to be at odds with the accepted story of how Wright himself described the process. Anyone with an interest in architecture or in Frank Lloyd Wright-or indeed anyone whos ever had an addition put on to their house or a kitchen remodeled-will be caught up in the story of the tumultuous, chaotic creation of a modern masterpiece, which comes to life in The Noble Room.') ;

Its time to fight back Shame is a powerful and sometimes useful tool. When we publicly shame corrupt politicians, abusive celebrities, or predatory corporations, we reinforce values of fairness and justice. But as best-selling author Cathy ONeil argues in this revelatory book, shaming has taken a new and dangerous turn. It is increasingly being weaponized -- used as a way to shift responsibility for social problems from institutions to individuals. Shaming children for not being able to afford school lunches or adults for not being able to find work lets us off the hook as a society. After all, why pay higher taxes to fund programmes for people who are fundamentally unworthy? ONeil explores the machinery behind all this shame, showing how governments, corporations and the healthcare system capitalize on it. There are damning stories of rehab clinics, reentry programs, drug and diet companies, and social media platforms -- all of which profit from punching down on the vulnerable. Woven throughout The Shame Machine is the story of ONeils own struggle with body image and her recent weight-loss surgery, which awakened her to the systematic shaming of fat people seeking medical care. With clarity and nuance, ONeil dissects the relationship between shame and power. Whom does the system serve? How do current incentive structures perpetuate the shaming cycle? And, most important, how can we all fight back?') ;

In a lively and engrossing narrative that spans theaters of operations around the world, Geoffrey Perret tells how the Army was drafted, trained, organized, armed, and led at every stage of the war. Beginning with the prescient military planners of the 1930s, he offers vivid warts-and-all profiles of the farsighted commanders who would lead the way, men like Marshall, MacArthur, Eisenhower, Ridgway, Bradley, and Patton. Drawing heavily on important new source material in major archives throughout the United States, THERES A WAR TO BE WON offers new insights into the wartime Army, its commanders, and its battles.

Torrance, who is generally considered to have been one of the most significant theologians writing in English during the twentieth century, with a view toward showing how his theological method and all his major doctrinal views were shaped by his understanding of the doctrine of the Trinity. Torrance pursued a theology that was realist because he attempted to think in accordance with the unique nature of the object that is known. In holding to such a methodology, he drew an analogy between theology and natural science. This book demonstrates how, for Torrance, God relates with humanity within time and space so that creation finds its meaning in relation to God and not in itself; this enabled him to avoid many theological pitfalls such as agnosticism, subjectivism and dualism while explaining the positive implications of various Christian doctrines in a penetrating and compelling manner. This book offers an important resource for students of theology and for scholars who are interested in seeing how serious dogmatic theology shapes and should shape our understanding of the Christian life.') ;

With The Jazz Singer he supervised the innovation of film sound. With The Public Enemy and Little Caesar he reinvented the gangster film. With 42nd Street he reinvigorated the musical. He set the standard for film biography with pictures such as Young Mr. Lincoln and The Story of Alexander Graham Bell . He innovated CinemaScope. And he molded the star images of James Cagney, Shirley Temple, Tyrone Power, Betty Grable, Marilyn Monroe, and Rin Tin Tin.In this major new biography, George F. Custen illuminates Zanucks evolution into one of the most influential producers in American film. He explains what set him apart from rivals Irving Thalberg and David O. Selznick, how he developed the gritty realism that came to redefine motion pictures, and how he brilliantly predicted and capitalized on changing public tastes.Zanuck was a man of enormous energy and eccentricity, commanding his studio with a sawed-off polo mallet. Dozens of his memorable films—including I Am a Fugitive from a Chain Gang , The Grapes of Wrath, Gentlemans Agreement, All About Eve, The Day the Earth Stood Still , and The Robe —have come to represent the era in which they were made. Hard-boiled or nostalgic, historical or pure Hollywood, Zanucks films and Zanuck himself have become legends of the cinema. But what exactly was this producers contribution to the films he made? How did he rise from being a writer of silent serials to become head of production at Warner Brothers by his mid-twenties, and then to form his own studio, Twentieth Century-Fox at age thirty-three?Twentieth Centurys Fox tells the whole story—from Zanucks boyhood to his tumultuous years with the feuding Warners, his battles with the censors and with his own actors, and the legendary acting-out of scenes during story conferences in his famous green office. Along the way, Custen treats us to inside stories about actors such as Edward G. Robinson, Gregory Peck, and Marilyn Monroe. In never-before-published story conference notes, telegrams, and surprisingly candid anecdotes, he reveals how—more than any producer before or since—this diminutive, enigmatic fellow from Wahoo, Nebraska, changed the way we look at film.Custen highlights the studio as the context of production. Zanucks ability to shape the producers role and the organizational style during the golden years of the studio system—with its own peculiar methods, clearly delineated rules, and pecking order—was the crucible out of which he forged a unique vision of American film and American culture.') ;

Unlike many other books on economic geology, both economic W-Sn skarns and non-economic examples are covered, in order to enable the academically-oriented reader to grasp the full range of such deposits, and also to aid the economic geologist in distinguishing between W-Sn skarns having economic potential and those which do not. W-Sn skarns are notoriously complex, containing a wide range of textures, grain sizes, mineral assemblages, bulk compositions and structures. The lack of a sufficiently detailed data base, coupled with some unsupportable genetic models, has led to many misunderstandings and has often resulted in needless expenditure and effort on fruitless mineral exploration. Thus, the first aim of this book is simply to provide an adequate data base with sufficient references to enable an interested worker to define a skarn deposit and know where to find additional information on similar examples.') ;

What is the future when an increasing number of jobs can be performed by intelligent machines instead of people, or done only by people in partnership with those machines? What happens to our consumer based societies—to workers and to the companies that depend on their purchasing power? Is income inequality and unemployment an inevitable consequence of technological advancement, or are there paths to a better future? What will happen to business when technology-enabled networks and marketplaces are better at deploying talent than traditional companies? How should companies organize themselves to take advantage of these new tools? What’s the future of education when on-demand learning outperforms traditional institutions? How can individuals continue to adapt and retrain? Will the fundamental social safety nets of the developed world survive the transition, and if not, what will replace them? OReilly is the man who can really can make a whole industry happen, according to Eric Schmidt, Executive Chairman of Alphabet (Google.) His genius over the past four decades has been to identify and to help shape our response to emerging technologies with world shaking potential—the World Wide Web, Open Source Software, Web 2.0, Open Government data, the Maker Movement, Big Data, and now AI.

He provides tools for understanding how all the parts of modern digital businesses work together to create marketplace advantage and customer value, and why ultimately, they cannot succeed unless their ecosystem succeeds along with them. The core of the books call to action is an exhortation to businesses to DO MORE with technology rather than just using it to cut costs and enrich their shareholders.

Hirschman, one of the twentieth centurys most original and provocative thinkers. In this gripping biography, Jeremy Adelman tells the story of a man shaped by modern horrors and hopes, a worldly intellectual who fought for and wrote in defense of the values of tolerance and change. Born in Berlin in 1915, Hirschman grew up amid the promise and turmoil of the Weimar era, but fled Germany when the Nazis seized power in 1933. Amid hardship and personal tragedy, he volunteered to fight against the fascists in Spain and helped many of Europes leading artists and intellectuals escape to America after France fell to Hitler. His intellectual career led him to Paris, London, and Trieste, and to academic appointments at Columbia, Harvard, and the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton. He was an influential adviser to governments in the United States, Latin America, and Europe, as well as major foundations and the World Bank. Along the way, he wrote some of the most innovative and important books in economics, the social sciences, and the history of ideas. Throughout, he remained committed to his belief that reform is possible, even in the darkest of times. This is the first major account of Hirschmans remarkable life, and a tale of the twentieth century as seen through the story of an astute and passionate observer. Adelmans riveting narrative traces how Hirschmans personal experiences shaped his unique intellectual perspective, and how his enduring legacy is one of hope, open-mindedness, and practical idealism--') ;

Ο Βλαντίμιρ Πούτιν, με ελάχιστη κυβερνητική και διοικητική εμπειρία πέρα από τη θητεία του ως αντιδημάρχου της Αγίας Πετρούπολης και ένα σύντομο διάστημα στη θέση του διευθυντή της μυστικής αστυνομίας, έμοιαζε ωστόσο η τέλεια λύση: ένα «απρόσωπο» πλάσμα που ο Γέλτσιν και οι στενοί του φίλοι πίστευαν πως μπορούσαν να διαμορφώσουν κατ’ εικόνα τους. Ξαφνικά το αγόρι που είχε μεγαλώσει στις σχολικές αυλές του μεταπολεμικού Λένινγκραντ παίζοντας ξύλο και κάνοντας όνειρα να κυβερνήσει τον κόσμο έγινε δημόσιο πρόσωπο και η δημοτικότητά του εκτοξεύτηκε στα ύψη. Η Ρωσία και μια ξελογιασμένη Δύση ήταν αποφασισμένες να βλέπουν τον προοδευτικό ηγέτη των ονείρων τους, ακόμα και όταν, με ανελέητη αποτελεσματικότητα, ο Πούτιν ξήλωνε τα μέσα ενημέρωσης της χώρας, αποσπούσε διά της βίας από την ανθούσα επιχειρηματική τάξη τον έλεγχο και τα πλούτη της και αποδεκάτιζε τους εύθραυστους μηχανισμούς της δημοκρατίας. Μέσα σε ελάχιστα χρόνια, ουσιαστικά κάθε εμπόδιο για την αχαλίνωτη κυριαρχία του απομακρύνθηκε και κάθε αντίθετη φωνή φιμώθηκε, με τους πολιτικούς αντιπάλους και τους επικριτές να οδηγούνται στην εξορία ή στον τάφο.Ως δημοσιογράφος που ζει στη Μόσχα, η Μάσα Γκέσεν βίωσε από πρώτο χέρι αυτή την ιστορία και για το βιβλίο της χρησιμοποίησε στοιχεία και πηγές που κανένας άλλος συγγραφέας δεν έχει αξιοποιήσει. Η εξιστόρηση του τρόπου με τον οποίο ένας «απρόσωπος» άνθρωπος ελίχτηκε για να φτάσει στην απόλυτη –και απόλυτα διεφθαρμένη– εξουσία διαθέτει όλα τα χαρακτηριστικά ενός κλασικού μη λογοτεχνικού πεζογραφήματος.

Καθώς φροντίζει για τις υποθέσεις του πατέρα του και σκαλίζει τα υπάρχοντά του, ο Auster ανακαλύπτει ένα οικογενειακό μυστικό: έναν φόνο που χρονολογείται εξήντα χρόνια πριν, ο οποίος θα φωτίσει τον απροσδιόριστο χαρακτήρα του πατέρα του.

Το ένα τρίτο των παιδιών παρουσιάζουν προβλήµατα ύπνου. Οι συνέπειες είναι εµφανείς τόσο στα παιδιά που γίνονται ευερέθιστα, ανασφαλή και, ως εκ τούτου, καταλήγουν να έχουν προβλήµατα στο σχολείο και στη δηµιουργία σχέσεων µε τους άλλους–, όσο και στους γονείς, οι οποίοι βλέπουν πως η εξάντληση και τα νεύρα βλάπτουν τη συζυγική τους ζωή. Ο δρ Εδουάρδ Εστιβίλ ερευνά όλες τις ιδιαιτερότητες του ύπνου για περισσότερα από σαράντα χρόνια. Το ερευνητικό έργο και η κλινική πείρα του τον έχουν αναδείξει παγκοσµίως σε σηµείο αναφοράς στο πεδίο των διαταραχών του ύπνου. Εφαρµόζοντας τις γνώσεις του ως νευροφυσιολόγου και παιδιάτρου έχει δηµιουργήσει τη Μέθοδο Εστιβίλ, η οποία αποσκοπεί στην αντιµετώπιση της παιδικής αϋπνίας και έχει αποδειχτεί αποτελεσµατική στο ενενήντα έξι τοις εκατό των περιπτώσεων όπου εφαρµόστηκε. Στη νέα, εµπλουτισµένη έκδοση του «Κοιµήσου, παιδί µου», ο Εστιβίλ λαµβάνει υπόψη του όλες τις επιστηµονικές γνώσεις που αποκτήθηκαν τα τελευταία χρόνια και παρουσιάζει την πιο έγκυρη και πιο αποτελεσµατική εκδοχή της µεθόδου του. Το «Κοιµήσου, παιδί µου» έχει γίνει µπεστ σέλερ και είναι απολύτως απαραίτητο για τους γονείς εκείνους που πρέπει να καταπολεµήσουν την παιδική αϋπνία».

ΞΥΠΝΑΣ ΜΕΣΑ ΣΤΑ ΑΙΜΑΤA. ΣΤΟΝ ΚΑΤΩ ΟΡΟΦΟ ΥΠΑΡΧΕΙ ΕΝΑ ΠΤΩΜΑ: ΤΟ ΠΤΩΜΑ ΤΗΣ ΜΗΤΕΡΑΣ ΣΟΥ. ΔΕΝ ΤΟ ΕΚΑΝΕΣ ΕΣΥ.

Ο Γιου-τζιν σύντομα ανακαλύπτει το πτώμα της σε μια λίμνη αίματος στον κάτω όροφο του σπιτιού τους στη Σεούλ. Δεν θυμάται πολλά για την περασμένη νύχτα· σχεδόν όλη του τη ζωή υποφέρει από επιληψία, οπότε συχνά έχει προβλήματα με τη μνήμη του. Το μόνο που θυμάται, κι αυτό αχνά, είναι η μητέρα του να φωνάζει τ’ όνομά του.
